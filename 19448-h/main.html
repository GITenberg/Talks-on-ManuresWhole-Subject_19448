AND ENLARGED EDITION.</a></h5>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Sir John Bennet Lawes kindly consented to write a Chapter for the new
edition of this work. The Deacon, the Doctor, the Squire, Charlie and
myself all felt flattered and somewhat bashful at finding ourselves in
such distinguished company. I&nbsp;need not say that this new Chapter
from the pen of the most eminent English agricultural investigator is
worthy of a very careful study. I&nbsp;have read it again and again, and
each time with great and renewed interest. I&nbsp;could wish there was
more of it. But to the intelligent and well-informed reader this Chapter
will be valued not merely for what it contains, but for what it omits.
A&nbsp;man who knew less would write more. Sir John goes straight to the
mark, and we have here his mature views on one of the most important
questions in agricultural science and practice.</p>

<p>Sir John describes a tract of poor land, and tells us that the
cheapest method of improving and enriching it is, to keep a large
breeding flock of sheep, and feed them American cotton-seed cake. We are
pleased to find that this is in accordance with the general teaching of
our “Talks,” as given in this book several years ago.</p>

<p>When this work was first published, some of my friends expressed
surprise that I did not recommend the more extended use of artificial
manures. One thing is certain, since that time the use of superphosphate
has been greatly on the increase. And it seems clear that its use must
be profitable. Where I live, in Western New York, it is sown quite
generally on winter wheat, and also on barley and oats in the spring. On
corn and potatoes, its use is not so common. Whether this is because its
application to these crops is not so easy, or because it does not
produce so marked an increase in the yield per acre, I&nbsp;am unable to
say.</p>

<p>Our winter wheat is sown here the first, second, or (rarely) the
third week in September. We sow from one and a half to two and a quarter
bushels per acre. It is almost invariably sown with a drill. The drill
has a fertilizer attachment that distributes the superphosphate at the
same time the wheat is

sown. The superphosphate is not mixed with the wheat, but it drops into
the same tubes with the wheat, and is sown with it in the same drill
mark. In this way, the superphosphate is deposited where the roots of
the young plants can immediately find it. For barley and oats the same
method is adopted.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the cost of sowing superphosphate on these crops
is merely nominal. But for corn and potatoes, when planted in hills, the
superphosphate must be dropped in the hill by hand, and, as we are
almost always hurried at that season of the year, we are impatient at
anything which will delay planting even for a day. The boys want to go
fishing!</p>

<p>This is, undoubtedly, one reason why superphosphate is not used so
generally with us for corn as for wheat, barley, and oats. Another
reason may be, that one hundred pounds of corn will not sell for
anything like as much as one hundred pounds of wheat, barley, and
oats.</p>

<p>We are now buying a very good superphosphate, made from Carolina rock
phosphate, for about one and a half cents per pound. We usually drill in
about two hundred pounds per acre at a cost of three dollars. Now, if
this gives us an increase of five bushels of wheat per acre, worth six
dollars, we think it pays. It often does far better than this. Last year
the wheat crop of Western New York was the best in a third of a century,
which is as far back as I have had anything to do with farming here.
From all I can learn, it is doubtful if the wheat crop of Western New
York has ever averaged a larger yield per acre since the land was first
cultivated after the removal of the original forest. Something of this
is due to better methods of cultivation and tillage, and something,
doubtless, to the general use of superphosphate, but much more to the
favorable season.</p>

<p>The present year our wheat crop turned out exceedingly poor. Hundreds
of acres of wheat were plowed up, and the land resown, and hundreds more
would have been plowed up had it not been for the fact that the land was
seeded with timothy grass at the time of sowing the wheat, and with
clover in the spring. We do not like to lose our grass and clover.</p>

<p>Dry weather in the autumn was the real cause of the poor yield of
wheat this year. True, we had a very trying winter, and a still more
trying spring, followed by dry, cold weather. The season was very
backward. We were not able to sow anything in the fields before the
first of May, and our wheat ought to have been ready to harvest in July.
On the first
<span class = "pagenum">IX</span>
<a name = "pageIX" id = "pageIX"> </a>
of May, many of our wheat-fields, especially on clay land, looked as
bare as a naked fallow.</p>

<p>There was here and there, a good field of wheat. As a rule, it was on
naturally moist land, or after a good summer-fallow, sown early.
I&nbsp;know of but one exception. A&nbsp;neighboring nursery firm had a
very promising field of wheat, which was sown late. But their land is
rich and unusually well worked. It is, in fact, in the very highest
condition, and, though sown late, the young plants were enabled to make
a good strong growth in the autumn.</p>

<p>In such a dry season, the great point is, to get the seed to
germinate, and to furnish sufficient moisture and food to enable the
young plants to make a strong, vigorous growth of roots in the autumn.
I&nbsp;do not say that two hundred pounds of superphosphate per acre,
drilled in with the seed, will always accomplish this object. But it is
undoubtedly a great help. It does not furnish the nitrogen which the
wheat requires, but if it will stimulate the production of roots in the
early autumn, the plants will be much more likely to find a sufficient
supply of nitrogen in the soil than plants with fewer and smaller
roots.</p>

<p>In a season like the past, therefore, an application of two hundred
pounds of superphosphate per acre, costing three dollars, instead of
giving an increase of five or six bushels per acre, may give us an
increase of fifteen or twenty bushels per acre. That is to say, owing to
the dry weather in the autumn, followed by severe weather in the winter,
the weak plants on the unmanured land may either be killed out
altogether, or injured to such an extent that the crop is hardly worth
harvesting, while the wheat where the phosphate was sown may give us
almost an average crop.</p>

<p>Sir John B. Lawes has somewhere compared the owner of land to the
owner of a coal mine. The owner of the coal digs it and gets it to
market in the best way he can. The farmer’s coal mine consists of plant
food, and the object of the farmer is to get this food into such plants,
or such parts of plants, as his customers require. It is hardly worth
while for the owner of the coal mine to trouble his head about the
exhaustion of the supply of coal. His true plan is to dig it as
economically as he can, and get it into market. There is a good deal of
coal in the world, and there is a good deal of plant food in the earth.
As long as the plant food lies dormant in the soil, it is of no value to
man. The object of the farmer is to convert it into products which man
and animals require.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">X</span>
<a name = "pageX" id = "pageX"> </a>
Mining for coal is a very simple matter, but how best to get the
greatest quantity of plant food out of the soil, with the least waste
and the greatest profit, is a much more complex and difficult task.
Plant food consists of a dozen or more different substances. We have
talked about them in the pages of this book, and all I wish to say here
is that some of them are much more abundant, and more readily obtained,
than others. The three substances most difficult to get at are: nitric
acid, phosphoric acid and potash. All these substances are in the soil,
but some soils contain much more than others, and their relative
proportion varies considerably. The substance which is of the greatest
importance, is nitric acid. As a rule, the fertility of a soil is in
proportion to the amount of nitric acid which becomes available for the
use of plants during the growing season. Many of our soils contain large
quantities of nitrogen, united with carbon, but the plants do not take
it up in this form. It has to be converted into nitric acid. Nitric acid
consists of seven pounds of nitrogen and twenty pounds of oxygen. It is
produced by the combustion of nitrogen. Since these “Talks” were
published, several important facts have been discovered in regard to how
plants take up nitrogen, and especially in regard to how organic
nitrogen is converted into nitric acid. It is brought about through the
action of a minute fungoid plant. There are several things necessary for
the growth of this plant. We must have some nitrogenous substance,
a&nbsp;moderate degree of heat, say from seventy to one hundred and
twenty degrees, a&nbsp;moderate amount of moisture, and plenty of
oxygen. Shade is also favorable. If too hot or too cold, or too wet or
too dry, the growth of the plant is checked, and the formation of nitric
acid suspended. The presence of lime, or of some alkali, is also
necessary for the growth of this fungus and the production of nitric
acid. The nitric acid unites with the lime, and forms nitrate of lime,
or with soda to form nitrate of soda, or with potash to form nitrate of
potash, or salt-petre. A&nbsp;water-logged soil, by excluding the
oxygen, destroys this plant, hence one of the advantages of
underdraining. I&nbsp;have said that shade is favorable to the growth of
this fungus, and this fact explains and confirms the common idea that
shade is manure.</p>

<p>The great object of agriculture is to convert the nitrogen of our
soils, or of green crops plowed under, or of manure, into nitric acid,
and then to convert this nitric acid into profitable products with as
little loss as possible. Nitrogen, or rather
<span class = "pagenum">XI</span>
<a name = "pageXI" id = "pageXI"> </a>
nitric acid, is the most costly ingredient in plant food, and
unfortunately it is very easily washed out of the soil and lost. Perhaps
it is absolutely impossible to entirely prevent all loss from leaching;
but it is certainly well worth our while to understand the subject, and
to know exactly what we are doing. In a new country, where land is
cheap, it may be more profitable to raise as large crops as possible
without any regard to the loss of nitric acid. But this condition of
things does not last long, and it very soon becomes desirable to adopt
less wasteful processes.</p>

<p>In Lawes and Gilbert’s experiments, there is a great loss of nitric
acid from drainage. In no case has as much nitrogen been obtained in the
increased crop as was applied in the manure. There is always a loss and
probably always will be. But we should do all we can to make this loss
as small as possible, consistent with the production of profitable
crops.</p>

<p>There are many ways of lessening this loss of nitric acid. Our
farmers sow superphosphate with their wheat in the autumn, and this
stimulates, we think, the growth of roots, which ramify in all
directions through the soil. This increased growth of root brings the
plant in contact with a larger feeding surface, and enables it to take
up more nitric acid from its solution in the soil. Such is also the case
during the winter and early spring, when a good deal of water permeates
through the soil. The application of superphosphate, unquestionably in
many cases, prevents much loss of nitric acid. It does this by giving us
a much greater growth of wheat.</p>

<p>I was at Rothamsted in 1879, and witnessed the injurious effect of an
excessive rainfall, in washing out of the soil nitrate of soda and salts
of ammonia, which were sown with the wheat in the autumn. It was an
exceedingly wet season, and the loss of nitrates on all the different
plots was very great. But where the nitrates or salts of ammonia were
sown in the spring, while the crops were growing, the loss was not
nearly so great as when sown in the autumn.</p>

<p>The sight of that wheat field impressed me, as nothing else could,
with the importance of guarding against the loss of available nitrogen
from leaching, and it has changed my practice in two or three important
respects. I&nbsp;realize, as never before, the importance of applying
manure to crops, rather than to the land. I&nbsp;mean by this, that the
object of applying manure is, not simply to make land rich, but to make
crops grow. Manure is a costly and valuable article, and we want to
convert
<span class = "pagenum">XII</span>
<a name = "pageXII" id = "pageXII"> </a>
it into plants, with as little delay as possible, which will, directly
or indirectly, bring in some money.</p>

<p>Our climate is very different from that of England. As a rule, we
seldom have enough rain, from the time corn is planted until it is
harvested, to more than saturate the ground on our upland soils. This
year is an exception. On Sunday night, May 20, 1883, we had a northeast
storm which continued three days. During these three days, from three to
five inches of rain fell, and for the first time in many years, at this
season, my underdrains discharged water to their full capacity. Had
nitrate of soda been sown on bare land previous to this rain, much of it
would, doubtless, have been lost by leaching. This, however, is an
exceptional case. My underdrains usually do not commence to discharge
water before the first of December, or continue later than the first of
May. To guard against loss of nitrogen by leaching, therefore, we should
aim to keep rich land occupied by some crop, during the winter and early
spring, and the earlier the crop is sown in the autumn or late summer,
the better, so that the roots will the more completely fill the ground
and take up all the available nitrogen within their reach. I&nbsp;have
said that this idea had modified my own practice. I&nbsp;grow a
considerable quantity of garden vegetables, principally for seed. It is
necessary to make the land very rich. The plan I have adopted to guard
against the loss of nitrogen is this: As soon as the land is cleared of
any crop, after it is too late to sow turnips, I&nbsp;sow it with rye at
the rate of one and a half to two bushels per acre. On this rich land,
especially on the moist low land, the rye makes a great growth during
our warm autumn weather. The rye checks the growth of weeds, and
furnishes a considerable amount of succulent food for sheep, during the
autumn or in the spring. If not needed for food, it can be turned under
in the spring for manure. It unquestionably prevents the loss of
considerable nitric acid from leaching during the winter and early
spring.</p>

<p>Buckwheat, or millet, is sometimes sown on such land for plowing
under as manure, but as these crops are killed out by the winter, they
cannot prevent the loss of nitric acid during the winter and spring
months. It is only on unusually rich land that such precautions are
particularly necessary. It has been thought that these experiments of
Lawes and Gilbert afford a strong argument against the use of
summer-fallows. I&nbsp;do not think so. A&nbsp;summer-fallow, in this
country, is usually a piece of land which has been seeded down one, two,
and
<span class = "pagenum">XIII</span>
<a name = "pageXIII" id = "pageXIII"> </a>
sometimes three years, with red clover. The land is plowed in May or
June, and occasionally in July, and is afterwards sown to winter wheat
in September. The treatment of the summer-fallow varies in different
localities and on different farms.</p>

<p>Sometimes the land is only plowed once. The clover, or sod, is plowed
under deep and well, and the after-treatment consists in keeping the
surface soil free from weeds, by the frequent use of the harrow, roller,
cultivator or gang-plow. In other cases, especially on heavy clay land,
the first plowing is done early in the spring, and when the sod is
sufficiently rotted, the land is cross-plowed, and afterwards made fine
and mellow by the use of the roller, harrow, and cultivator. Just before
sowing the wheat, many good, old-fashioned farmers, plow the land again.
But in this section, a&nbsp;summer-fallow, plowed two or three times
during the summer, is becoming more and more rare every year.</p>

<p>Those farmers who summer-fallow at all, as a rule, plow their land
but once, and content themselves with mere surface cultivation
afterwards. It is undoubtedly true, also, that summer fallows of all
kinds are by no means as common as formerly. This fact may be considered
an argument against the use of summer-fallowing; but it is not
conclusive in my mind. Patient waiting is not a characteristic of the
age. We are inclined to take risks. We prefer to sow our land to oats,
or barley, and run the chance of getting a good wheat crop after it,
rather than to spend several months in cleaning and mellowing the land,
simply to grow one crop of wheat.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me entirely unnecessary to urge farmers not
to summer-fallow. We all naturally prefer to see the land occupied by a
good paying crop, rather than to spend time, money, and labor, in
preparing it to produce a crop twelve or fifteen months afterwards. Yet
some of the agricultural editors and many of the agricultural writers,
seem to take delight in deriding the old-fashioned summer-fallow. The
fact that Lawes and Gilbert in England find that, when land contains
considerable nitric acid, the water which percolates through the soil to
the underdrains beneath, contains more nitrate of lime when the land is
not occupied by a crop, than when the roots of growing plants fill the
soil, is deemed positive proof that summer-fallowing is a wasteful
practice.</p>

<p>If we summer-fallowed for a spring crop, as I have sometimes done, it
is quite probable that there would be a loss of nitrogen. But, as I have
said before, it is very seldom that any
<span class = "pagenum">XIV</span>
<a name = "pageXIV" id = "pageXIV"> </a>
water passes through the soil from the time we commence the
summer-fallow until the wheat is sown in the autumn, or for many weeks
afterwards. The nitrogen, which is converted into nitric acid by the
agency of a good summer-fallow, is no more liable to be washed out of
the soil after the field is sown to wheat in the autumn, than if we
applied the nitrogen in the form of some readily available manure.</p>

<p>I still believe in summer fallows. If I had my life to live over
again, I&nbsp;would certainly summer-fallow more than I have done.
I&nbsp;have been an agricultural writer for one-third of a century, and
have persistently advocated the more extended use of the summer-fallow.
I&nbsp;have nothing to take back, unless it is what I have said in
reference to “fall-fallowing.” Possibly this practice may result in
loss, though I do not think&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>A good summer-fallow, on rather heavy clay land, if the conditions
are otherwise favorable, is pretty sure to give us a good crop of wheat,
and a good crop of clover and grass afterwards. Of course, a&nbsp;farmer
who has nice, clean sandy soil, will not think of summer-fallowing it.
Such soils are easily worked, and it is not a difficult matter to keep
them clean without summer-fallowing. Such soils, however, seldom contain
a large store of unavailable plant food, and instead of
summer-fallowing, we had better manure. On such soils artificial manures
are often very profitable, though barn-yard manure, or the droppings of
animals feeding on the land, should be the prime basis of all attempts
to maintain, or increase, the productiveness of such soils.</p>

<p>Since this book was first published, I&nbsp;do not know of any new
facts in regard to the important question of, how best to manage and
apply our barn-yard manure, so as to make it more immediately active and
available. It is unquestionably true, that the same amount of nitrogen
in barn-yard manure, will not produce so great an effect as its
theoretical value would indicate. There can be no doubt, however, that
the better we feed our animals, and the more carefully we save the
liquids, the more valuable and active will be the manure.</p>

<p>The conversion of the inert nitrogen of manures and soils, into
nitric acid, as already stated, is now known to be produced by a minute
fungus. I&nbsp;hope it will be found that we can introduce this
<i>bacterium</i> into our manure piles, in such a way as to greatly aid
the conversion of inert nitrogen into nitrates.</p>

<p>Experiments have been made, and are still continued, at Woburn, under
the auspices of the Royal Agricultural Society
<span class = "pagenum">XV</span>
<a name = "pageXV" id = "pageXV"> </a>
of England, to ascertain, among other things, whether manure from sheep
receiving an allowance of cotton-seed cake is any richer than that from
sheep, otherwise fed alike, but having, instead of cotton-seed cake, the
same amount of corn meal. We know that such manure contains more
nitrogen, and other plant food, than that from the corn meal. But the
experiments so far, though they have been continued for several years,
do not show any striking superiority of the manure from cotton-seed cake
over that from corn meal. I&nbsp;saw the wheat on these differently
manured plots in 1879. Dr. Vœlcker and Dr. Gilbert<ins class =
"correction" title = "commas as in original">, told me that,</ins> one
of two plots was dressed with the cotton-seed manure, and the other with
the corn meal manure, and they wanted me to say which was the most
promising crop. I&nbsp;believe the one I said was the better, was the
cotton-seed plot. But the difference was very slight. The truth is that
such experiments must be continued for many years before they will prove
anything. As I said before, we know that the manure from the cotton-seed
cake is richer in nitrogen than that from the corn meal; but we also
know that this nitrogen will not produce so great an effect, as a much
smaller amount of nitrogen in salts of ammonia, or nitrate of soda.</p>

<p>In going over these experiments, I&nbsp;was struck with the healthy
and vigorous appearance of one of the plots of wheat, and asked how it
was manured. Dr. Vœlcker called out, “clover, Mr. Harris, clover.” In
England, as in America, it requires very little observation and
experience to convince any one of the value of clover. After what I have
said, and what the Deacon, the Doctor, Charley and the Squire have said,
in the pages of this book, I&nbsp;hope no one will think that I do not
appreciate the great value of red clover as a means of enriching our
land. Dr. Vœlcker evidently thought I was skeptical on this point.
I&nbsp;am not. I&nbsp;have great faith in the benefits to be derived
from the growth of clover. But I do not think it originates fertility;
it does not get nitrogen from the atmosphere. Or at any rate, we have no
evidence of it. The facts are all the other way. We have discussed this
question at considerable length in the pages of this book, and it is not
necessary to say more on the subject. I&nbsp;would, however,
particularly urge farmers, especially those who are using phosphates
freely, to grow as much clover as possible, and feed it out on the farm,
or plow it under for manure.</p>

<p>The question is frequently asked, whether the use of phosphates will
ultimately impoverish our farms. It may, or it may
<span class = "pagenum">XVI</span>
<a name = "pageXVI" id = "pageXVI"> </a>
not. It depends on our general management. Theoretically, the use of a
manure furnishing only one element of plant food, if it increases the
growth of crops which are sold from the farm, must have a tendency to
impoverish the land of the other elements of plant food. In other words,
the use of superphosphate furnishing only, or principally, phosphoric
acid, lime and sulphuric acid, must have a tendency to impoverish the
soil of nitrogen and potash. Practically, however, it need do nothing of
the kind. If the land is well cultivated, and if our low, rich, alluvial
portions of the farm are drained, and if the hay, grass, clover, straw
and fodder crops are retained, the more phosphates we use, the richer
and more productive will the farm become. And I think it is a fact, that
the farmers who use the most phosphates, are the very men who take the
greatest pains to drain their land, cultivate it thoroughly, and make
the most manure. It follows, therefore, that the use of phosphates is a
national benefit.</p>

<p>Some of our railroad managers take this view of the subject. They
carry superphosphate at a low rate, knowing that its use will increase
the freight the other way. In other words, they bring a ton of
superphosphate from the seaboard, knowing that its use will give them
many tons of freight of produce, from the interior to the seaboard. It
is not an uncommon thing for two hundred pounds of superphosphate, to
give an increase of five tons of turnips per acre. Or, so to speak, the
railroad that brings one ton of superphosphate from the seaboard, might,
as the result of its use, have fifty tons of freight to carry back
again. This is perhaps an exceptionably favorable instance, but it
illustrates the principle. Years ago, before the abolition of tolls on
the English turnpike roads, carriages loaded with lime, and all other
substances intended for manure, were allowed to go free. And our
railroads will find it to their interest to transport manures of all
kinds, at a merely nominal rate.</p>

<p>Many people will be surprised at the recommendation of Sir John B.
Lawes, not to waste time and money in cleaning poor land, before seeding
it down to grass. He thinks that if the land is made rich, the superior
grasses overgrow the bad grasses and weeds. I&nbsp;have no doubt he is
right in this, though the principle may be pushed to an extreme. Our
climate, in this country, is so favorable for killing weeds, that the
plow and the cultivator will probably be a more economical means of
making our land clean, than the liberal use of expensive
<span class = "pagenum">XVII</span>
<a name = "pageXVII" id = "pageXVII"> </a>
manures. It depends, doubtless, on the land and on circumstances. It is
well to know that manure on grass land, will so increase the growth of
the good grasses, as to smother the weeds. Near my house was a piece of
land that I wanted to make into a lawn. I&nbsp;sowed it with grass seed,
but the weeds smothered it out. I&nbsp;plowed it, and hoed it, and
re-seeded it, but still the weeds grew. Mallows came up by the thousand,
with other weeds too numerous to mention. It was an eye-sore. We mowed
the weeds, but almost despaired of ever making a decent bit of grass
land out of it. It so happened that, one year, we placed the chicken
coops on this miserable weedy spot. The hens and chickens were kept
there for several weeks. The feed and the droppings made it look more
unsightly than ever, but the next spring, as if by magic, the weeds were
gone and the land was covered with dark green luxuriant grass.</p>

<p>In regard to the use of potash as a manure, we have still much to
learn. It would seem that our grain crops will use soda, if they cannot
get potash. They much prefer the potash, and will grow much more
luxuriantly where, in the soil or manure, in addition to the other
elements of plant food, potash is abundant. But the increased growth
caused by the potash, is principally, if not entirely, straw, or leaves
and stem. Nature makes a great effort to propagate the species.
A&nbsp;plant of wheat or barley, will produce seed if this is possible,
even at the expense of the other parts of the plant.</p>

<p>For grain crops, grown for seed, therefore, it would seem to be
entirely unprofitable to use potash as a manure. If the soil contains
the other elements of plant food, the addition of potash may give us a
much more luxuriant growth of leaves and stem, but no more grain or
seed. For hay, or grass or fodder crops, the case is very different, and
potash may often be used on these crops to great advantage.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that considerable nitrate of soda will yet be
used in this country for manure. I&nbsp;do not suppose it will pay as a
rule, on wheat, corn and other standard grain crops. But the gardener,
seed grower, and nurseryman, will find out how to use it with great
profit. Our nurserymen say that they cannot use artificial manures with
any advantage. It is undoubtedly true that a dressing of superphosphate,
sown on a block of nursery trees, will do little good. It never reaches
the roots of the plants. Superphosphate can not be washed down deep into
the soil. Nitrate of soda is readily carried down, as
<span class = "pagenum">XVIII</span>
<a name = "pageXVIII" id = "pageXVIII"> </a>
deep as the water sinks. For trees, therefore, it would seem desirable
to apply the <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘superhosphate’"> superphosphate</ins> before they are
planted, and plow it under. And the same is true of potash; but nitrate
of soda would be better applied as a top-dressing every year, early in
the spring.</p>

<p>The most discouraging fact, in Lawes’ and Gilbert’s experiments, is
the great loss of nitrogen. It would seem that, on an average, during
the last forty years, about one-half the nitrogen is washed out of the
soil, or otherwise lost. I&nbsp;can not but hope and believe that, at
any rate in this country, there is no such loss in practical
agriculture. In Lawes’ and Gilbert’s experiments on wheat, this grain is
grown year after year, on the same land. Forty annual crops have been
removed. No clover is sown with the wheat, and great pains are taken to
keep the land clean. The crop is hoed while growing, and the weeds are
pulled out by hand. The best wheat season during the forty years, was
the year 1863. The poorest, that of 1879; and it so happened, that after
an absence of thirty years, I&nbsp;was at Rothamsted during this poor
year of 1879. The first thing that struck me, in looking at the
experimental wheat, was the ragged appearance of the crop. My own wheat
crop was being cut the day I left home, July 15. Several men and boys
were pulling weeds out of the experimental wheat, two weeks later. Had
the weeds been suffered to grow, Sir John Bennet Lawes tells us, there
would be less loss of nitrogen. The loss of nitrogen in 1863, was about
twenty-four pounds per acre, and in 1879 fifty pounds per acre&mdash;the
amount of available nitrogen, applied in each year, being eighty-seven
pounds per acre. As I said before, the wheat in 1879 had to me a ragged
look. It was thin on the ground. There were not plants enough to take up
and evaporate the large amount of water which fell during the wet
season. Such a condition of things rarely occurs in this country. We sow
timothy with our winter wheat, in the autumn, and red clover in the
spring. After the wheat is harvested, we frequently have a heavy growth
of clover in the autumn. In such circumstances I believe there would be
comparatively little loss of nitrogen.</p>

<p>In the summer-fallow experiments, which have now been continued for
twenty-seven years, there has been a great loss of nitrogen. The same
remarks apply to this case. No one ever advocates summer-fallowing land
every other year, and sowing nothing but wheat. When we summer-fallow a
piece of land for wheat, we seed it down with grass and clover.
<span class = "pagenum">XIX</span>
<a name = "pageXIX" id = "pageXIX"> </a>
There is, as a rule, very little loss of nitrogen by drainage while the
wheat is growing on the ground, but after the wheat is cut, the grass
and clover are pretty sure to take up all the available nitrogen within
the range of their roots. This summer-fallow experiment, instead of
affording an argument against the use of summer-fallowing, is an
argument in its favor. The summer-fallow, by exposing the soil to the
decomposing influences of the atmosphere, converts more or less of the
inert nitrogenous organic matter into ammonia and nitric acid. This is
precisely what a farmer wants. It is just what the wheat crop needs. But
we must be very careful, when we render the nitrogen soluble, to have
some plant ready to take it up, and not let it be washed out of the soil
during the winter and early spring.</p>

<p>We have much poor land in the United States, and an immense area of
good land. The poor land will be used to grow timber, or be improved by
converting more or less of it, gradually, into pasture, and stocking it
with sheep and cattle. The main point is, to feed the sheep or cattle
with some rich nitrogenous food, such as cotton-seed cake, malt-sprouts,
bran, shorts, mill-feed, refuse beans, or bean-meal made from beans
injured by the weevil, or bug. In short, the owner of such land must buy
such food as will furnish the most nutriment and make the richest manure
at the least cost&mdash;taking both of these objects into consideration.
He will also buy more or less artificial manures, to be used for the
production of fodder crops, such as corn, millet, Hungarian grass, etc.
And, as soon as a portion of the land can be made rich enough, he will
grow more or less mangel wurzels, sugar beets, turnips, and other root
crops. Superphosphate will be found admirably adapted for this purpose,
and two, three, or four hundred pounds of cheap potash salts, per acre,
can frequently be used on fodder crops, in connection with two or three
hundred pounds of superphosphate, with considerable profit. The whole
subject is well worthy of careful study. Never in the history of the
world has there been a grander opportunity for the application of
science to the improvement of agriculture than now.</p>

<p>On the richer lands, the aim of the farmer will be to convert the
plant food lying dormant in the soil into profitable crops. The main
point is <i>good tillage</i>. In many cases weeds now run away with half
our crops and all our profits. The weeds which spring up after the grain
crops are harvested, are not an unmixed evil. They retain the nitrogen
and other plant food, and
<span class = "pagenum">XX</span>
<a name = "pageXX" id = "pageXX"> </a>
when turned under make manure for the succeeding crops. But weeds among
the growing crop are evil, and only an evil. Thorough plowing is the
remedy, accompanied by drainage where needed.</p>

<p>We have an immense number of farms on which there are both good and
poor land. In such cases we must adopt a combined system. We must grow
large crops on the rich land and use them, at least in part, to make
manure for the poorer portions of the farm. Drainage and good tillage
will convert much of our low, alluvial lands into a perfect mine of
wealth. And much of our high, rolling land consists of strong loam,
abounding in plant food. Such land requires little more than thorough
tillage, with perhaps two hundred pounds of superphosphate per acre, to
enable it to produce good grain crops.</p>

<p>After all is said and done, farming is a business that requires not
merely science, but industry, economy, and common sense. The real basis
of success is faith, accompanied with good works. I&nbsp;cannot
illustrate this better than by alluding to one of my neighbors,
a&nbsp;strong, healthy, intelligent, observing and enterprising German,
who commenced life as a farm laborer, and is to-day worth at least one
hundred thousand dollars, that he has made, not by the advance of
suburban property, but by farming, pure and simple. He first rented a
farm, and then bought it, and in a few years he bought another farm
adjoining the first one, and would to-day buy another if he found one
that suited him. He has faith in farming. Some people think he “runs his
land,” and, in fact, such is the case. He keeps good teams, and good
plows, and good harrows, and good rollers, and good cultivators, and
good grade Shorthorn cows. He acts as though he believed, as Sir John B.
Lawes says, that “the soil is a mine,” out of which he digs money. He
runs his land for all it is worth. He raises wheat, barley, oats, corn,
potatoes, and hay, and when he can get a good price for his timothy hay,
he draws it to market and sells it. Thorough tillage is the basis of his
success. He is now using phosphates for wheat, and will probably
increase his herd of cows and make more manure. He has great faith in
manure, but acts as though he had still greater faith in good plowing,
early sowing, and thorough cultivation.</p>

"preface">PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</a></h5>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The Printers have got our “Talks on Manures” in type; and the
publishers want a Preface.</p>

<p>The Deacon is busy hoeing his corn; the Doctor is gone to Rice Lake,
fishing; Charley is cultivating mangels; the Squire is haying, and I am
here alone, with a pencil in hand and a sheet of blank paper before me.
I&nbsp;would far rather be at work. In fact, I&nbsp;have only just come
in from the field.</p>

<p>Now, what shall I say? It will do no good to apologize for the
deficiencies of the book. If the critics condescend to notice it at all,
nothing I can say will propitiate their favor, or moderate their
censure. They are an independent set of fellows! I know them well,
I&nbsp;am an old editor myself, and nothing would please me better than
to sit down and write a slashing criticism of these “Talks on
Manures.”</p>

<p>But I am denied that pleasure. The critics have the floor.</p>

<p>All I will say here, is, that the book is what it pretends to be.
Some people seem to think that the “Deacon” is a fictitious character.
Nothing of the kind. He is one of the oldest farmers in town, and lives
on the farm next to me. I&nbsp;have the very highest respect for him.
I&nbsp;have tried to report him fully and correctly. Of my own share in
the conversations I will say little, and of the Doctor’s nothing. My own
views are honestly given. I&nbsp;hold myself responsible for them.
I&nbsp;may contradict in one chapter what I have asserted in another.
And so, probably, has the Deacon. I&nbsp;do not know whether this is or
is not the case. I&nbsp;know very well that on many questions “much can
be said on both sides”&mdash;and very likely the Deacon is sometimes on
the south side of the fence and I on the north side; and in the next
chapter you may find the Deacon on the north side, and where would you
have me go, except to the south side? We cannot see both sides of the
fence, if both of us walk on the same side!</p>

<p>I fear some will be disappointed at not finding a particular subject
discussed.</p>

<p>I have talked about those things which occupy my own thoughts.
<span class = "pagenum">XXII</span>
<a name = "pageXXII" id = "pageXXII"> </a>
There are some things not worth thinking about. There are others beyond
my reach.</p>

<p>I have said nothing about manures for cotton or for the
sugar-cane&mdash;not because I feel no interest in the matter, but
because I have had no experience in the cultivation of these important
crops. I&nbsp;might have told what the crops contain, and could have
given minute directions for furnishing in manure the exact quantity of
plant-food which the crops remove from the soil. But I have no faith in
such a system of farming. The few cotton-planters I have had the
pleasure of seeing were men of education and rare ability. I&nbsp;cannot
undertake to offer them advice. But I presume they will find that, if
they desire to increase the growth of the cotton-plant, in nine cases
out of ten they can do it, provided the soil is properly worked, by
supplying a manure containing available nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and
potash. But the <i>proper proportion</i> of these ingredients of
plant-food must be ascertained by experiment, and not from a mere
analysis of the cotton-plant.</p>

<p>I have much faith in artificial manures. They will do great things
for American agriculture&mdash;directly, and indirectly. Their general
use will lead to a higher system of farming&mdash;to better cultivation,
more root and fodder crops, improved stock, higher feeding, and richer
manure. But it has been no part of my object to unduly extol the virtues
of commercial manures. That may be left to the manufacturers.</p>

<p>My sympathy is with the farmer, and especially with the farmer of
moderate means, who finds that improved farming calls for more and more
capital. I&nbsp;would like to encourage such a man. And so, in point of
fact, would the Deacon, though he often talks as though a man who tries
to improve his farm will certainly come to poverty. Such men as the
Deacon are useful neighbors if their doubts, and head-shakings, and
shoulder-shruggings lead a young and enthusiastic farmer to put more
energy, industry, and economy into his business. It is well to listen to
the Deacon&mdash;to hear all his objections, and then to keep a sharp
look-out for the dangers and difficulties, and <i>go-ahead</i>.</p>
