<h5>FARMING AS A BUSINESS.</h5>

<p>“Farming is a poor business,” said the Deacon. “Take the corn crop.
Thirty bushels per acre is a fair average, worth, at 75 cents per
bushel, $22.50. If we reckon that, for each bushel of corn, we get 100
lbs. of stalks, this would be a ton and a half per acre, worth at $5 per
ton $7.50.”</p>

<p>Take another case, which actually occurred in this neighborhood. The
Judge is a good farmer, and particularly successful in raising potatoes
and selling them at a good price to hotels and private families. He
cultivates very thoroughly, plants in hills, and puts a handful of
ashes, plaster, and hen-manure, on the hill.</p>

<p>In 1873, his crop of Peachblows was at the rate of 208 bushels per
acre. Of these, 200 bushels were sold at 60 cents per bushel. There were
8 bushels of small potatoes, worth say 12½ cents per bushel, to feed out
to stock.</p>

<p>Mr. Sloe, who lives on an adjoining farm, had three acres of
Peachblow potatoes the same year. The yield was 100 bushels per
acre&mdash;of which 25 bushels were not large enough for market, he got
50 cents per bushel for the others.</p>

<p>Since then, Mr. Sloe has been making and using more manure, and the
year before last (1875) his crop of potatoes averaged over
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
200 bushels per acre, and on the sandy knolls, where more manure was
applied, the yield was at least 250 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” said the Deacon, “I&nbsp;do not believe in ‘high
farming.’ It will not pay.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not,” I replied. “It depends on circumstances; and these we
will talk about presently. High farming aims to get large crops every
year. <i>Good</i> farming produces equally large crops per acre, but not
so many of them. This is what I am trying to do on my own farm.
I&nbsp;am aiming to get 35 bushels of wheat per acre, 80 bushels of
shelled corn, 50 bushels of barley, 90 bushels of oats, 300 bushels of
potatoes, and 1,200 bushels of mangel-wurzel per acre, on the average.
I&nbsp;can see no way of paying high wages except by raising large crops
<i>per acre</i>. But if I get these large crops it does not necessarily
follow that I am practising ‘high farming.’”</p>

<p>To illustrate: Suppose I should succeed in getting such crops by
adopting the following plan. I&nbsp;have a farm of nearly 300 acres, one
quarter of it being low, alluvial land, too wet for cultivation, but
when drained excellent for pasturing cows or for timothy meadows.
I&nbsp;drain this land, and after it is drained I dam up some of the
streams that flow into it or through it, and irrigate wherever I can
make the water flow. So much for the low land.</p>

<p>The upland portion of the farm, containing say 200 acres, exclusive
of fences, roads, buildings, garden, etc., is a naturally fertile loam,
as good as the average wheat land of Western New York. But it is, or
was, badly “run down.” It had been what people call “worked to death;”
although, in point of fact, it had not been half-worked. Some said it
was “wheated to death,” others that it had been “oated to death,” others
that it had been “grassed to death,” and one man said to me, “That field
has had sheep on it until they have gnawed every particle of vegetable
matter out of the soil, and it will not now produce enough to pasture a
flock of geese.” And he was not far from right&mdash;notwithstanding the
fact that sheep are thought to be, and are, the best animals to enrich
land. But let me say, in passing, that I have since raised on that same
field 50 bushels of barley per acre, 33 bushels of Diehl wheat,
a&nbsp;great crop of clover, and last year, on a part of it, over 1,000
bushels of mangel-wurzel per acre.</p>

<p>But this is a digression. Let us carry out the illustration. What
does this upland portion of the farm need? It needs underdraining,
thorough cultivation, and <i>plenty of manure</i>. If I had plenty of
manure, I&nbsp;could adopt high farming. But where am I to get plenty of
manure for 200 acres of land? “Make it,” says the
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
Deacon. Very good; but what shall I make it of? “Make it out of your
straw and stalks and hay.” So I do, but all the straw and stalks and hay
raised on the farm when I bought it would not make as much manure as
“high farming” requires for five acres of land. And is this not true of
half the farms in the United States to-day? What then, shall we do?</p>

<p>The best thing to do, <i>theoretically</i>, is this: Any land that is
producing a fair crop of grass or clover, let it lie. Pasture it or mow
it for hay. If you have a field of clayey or stiff loamy land, break it
up in the fall, and summer-fallow it the next year, and sow it to wheat
and seed it down with clover. Let it lie two or three years in clover.
Then break it up in July or August, “fall-fallow” it, and sow it with
barley the next spring, and seed it down again with clover.</p>

<p>Sandy or light land, that it will not pay to summer-fallow, should
have all the manure you can make, and be plowed and planted with corn.
Cultivate thoroughly, and either seed it down with the corn in August,
or sow it to barley or oats next spring, and seed it down with clover.
I&nbsp;say, <i>theoretically</i> this is the best plan to adopt. But
practically it may not be so, because it may be absolutely necessary
that we should raise something that we can sell at once, and get money
to live upon or pay interest and taxes. But the gentlemen who so
strenuously advocate high farming, are not perhaps often troubled with
considerations of this kind. Meeting them, therefore, on their own
ground, I&nbsp;contend that in my case “high farming” would not be as
profitable as the plan hinted at above.</p>

<p>The rich alluvial low land is to be pastured or mown; the upland to
be broken up only when necessary, and when it is plowed to be plowed
well and worked thoroughly, and got back again into clover as soon as
possible. The hay and pasture from the low land, and the clover and
straw and stalks from the upland, would enable us to keep a good many
cows and sheep, with more or less pigs, and there would be a big pile of
manure in the yard every spring. And when this is once obtained, you can
get along much more pleasantly and profitably.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“But,” I may be asked, “when you have got this pile of manure can not
you adopt high farming?” No. My manure pile would contain say: 60 tons
of clover-hay; 20 tons wheat-straw; 25 tons oat, barley, and pea-straw;
40 tons meadow-hay; 20 tons corn-stalks; 20 tons corn, oats, and other
grain; 120 tons mangel-wurzel and turnips.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page13" id = "page13"> </a>
This would give me about 500 tons of well-rotted manure. I&nbsp;should
want 200 tons of this for the mangels and turnips, and the 300 tons I
should want to top-dress 20 acres of grass land intended for corn and
potatoes the next year. My pile of manure, therefore, is all used up on
25 to 30 acres of land. In other words, I&nbsp;use the unsold produce of
10 acres to manure one. Is this “high farming?” I think in my
circumstances it is good farming, but it is not high farming. It gives
me large crops per acre, but I have comparatively few acres in crops
that are sold from the farm.</p>

<p>“High farming,” if the term is to have any definite meaning at all
should only be used to express the idea of a farm so managed that the
soil is rich enough to produce maximum crops <i>every year</i>. If you
adopt the system of rotation quite general in this section&mdash;say,
1st year, corn on sod; 2d, barley or oats; 3d, wheat; 4th, clover for
hay and afterwards for seed; 5th, timothy and clover for hay; and then
the 6th year plowed up for corn again&mdash;it would be necessary to
make the land rich enough to produce say 100 bushels shelled corn, 50
bushels of barley, 40 bushels of wheat, 3 tons clover-hay, and 5 bushels
of clover-seed, and 3 tons clover and timothy-hay per acre. This would
be <i>moderate</i> high farming. If we introduced lucern, Italian
rye-grass, corn-fodder, and mangel-wurzel into the rotation, we should
need still richer land to produce a maximum growth of these crops. In
other words, we should need more manure.</p>

<p>The point I am endeavoring to get at, is this: Where you want a farm
to be self-supporting&mdash;where you depend solely on the produce of
the farm to supply manure&mdash;it is a sheer impossibility to adopt
high farming <i>on the whole of your land</i>. I&nbsp;want to raise just
as large crops per acre as the high farmers, but there is no way of
doing this, unless we go outside the farm for manure, without raising a
smaller area of such crops as are sold from the farm.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>I do not wish any one to suppose that I am opposed to high farming.
There is occasionally a farm where it may be practised with advantage,
but it seems perfectly clear to my mind that as long as there is such an
unlimited supply of <i>land</i>, and such a limited supply of
fertilizers, most of us will find it more profitable to develop the
latent stores of plant-food lying dormant in the soil rather than to buy
manures. And it is certain that you can not adopt high farming without
either buying manure directly, or buying food to feed to animals that
shall make manure on the farm.</p>

<p>And you must recollect that high farming requires an increased
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
supply of labor, and hired help is a luxury almost as costly as
artificial fertilizers.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>We have heard superficial thinkers object to agricultural papers on
the ground that they were urging farmers to improve their land and
produce larger crops, “while,” say they, “we are producing so much
already that it will not sell for as much as it costs to produce it.” My
plan of improved agriculture does not necessarily imply the production
of any more wheat or of any more grain of any kind that we sell than we
raise at present. I&nbsp;would simply raise it on fewer acres, and thus
lessen the expense for seed, cultivation, harvesting, etc. I&nbsp;would
raise 30 bushels of wheat per acre every third year, instead of 10
bushels every year.</p>

<p>If we summer-fallowed and plowed under clover in order to produce the
30 bushels of wheat once in three years, instead of 10 bushels every
year, no more produce of any kind would be raised. But my plan does not
contemplate such a result. On my own farm I seldom summer-fallow, and
never plow under clover. I&nbsp;think I can enrich the farm nearly as
much by feeding the clover to animals and returning the manure to the
land. The animals do not take out more than from five to ten per cent of
the more valuable elements of plant-food from the clover. And so my
plan, while it produces as much and no more grain to sell, adds greatly
to the fertility of the land, and gives an increased production of beef,
mutton, wool, butter, cheese, and pork.</p>

<p>“But what is a man to do who is poor and has poor land?” If he has
good health, is industrious, economical, and is possessed of a fair
share of good common sense, he need have no doubt as to being able to
renovate his farm and improve his own fortune.</p>

<p>Faith in good farming is the first requisite. If this is weak, it
will be strengthened by exercise. If you have not faith, act as though
you had.</p>

<p>Work hard, but do not be a drudge. A&nbsp;few hours’ vigorous labor
will accomplish a great deal, and encourage you to continued effort. Be
prompt, systematic, cheerful, and enthusiastic. Go to bed early and get
up when you wake. But take sleep enough. A&nbsp;man had better be in bed
than at the tavern or grocery. Let not friends, even, keep you up late;
“manners is manners, but still your elth’s your elth.”</p>

<p>“But what has this to do with good farming?” More than chemistry and
all the science of the schools. Agriculture is an art and must be
followed as such. Science will help&mdash;help enormously&mdash;but it
will never enable us to dispense with industry. Chemistry
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15" id = "page15"> </a>
throws great light on the art of cooking, but a farmer’s wife will roast
a turkey better than a Liebig.</p>

<p>When Mr. James O. Sheldon, of Geneva. N.Y., bought his farm, his
entire crop of hay the first year was 76 loads. He kept stock, and
bought more or less grain and bran, and in eleven years from that time
his farm produced 430 loads of hay, afforded pasture for his large herd
of Shorthorn cattle, and produced quite as much grain as when he first
took it.</p>

<p>Except in the neighborhood of large cities, “high farming” may not
pay, owing to the fact that we have so much land. But whether this is so
or not, there can be no doubt that the only profitable system of farming
is to raise large crops on such land as we cultivate. High farming gives
us large crops, and <i>many of them</i>. At present, while we have so
much land in proportion to population, we must, perhaps, be content with
large crops of grain, and few of them. We must adopt the slower but less
expensive means of enriching our land from natural sources, rather than
the quicker, more artificial, and costly means adopted by many farmers
in England, and by market gardeners, seed-growers, and nurserymen in
this country. Labor is so high that we can not afford to raise a small
crop. If we sow but half the number of acres, and double the yield, we
should quadruple our profits. I&nbsp;have made up my mind to let the
land lie in clover three years, instead of two. This will lessen the
number of acres under cultivation, and enable us to bestow more care in
plowing and cleaning it. And the land will be richer, and produce better
crops. The atmosphere is capable of supplying a certain quantity of
ammonia to the soil in rains and dews every year, and by giving the
wheat crop a three years supply instead of two years, we gain so much.
Plaster the clover, top-dress it in the fall, if you have the manure,
and stimulate its growth in every way possible, and consume all the
clover on the land, or in the barn-yard. Do not sell a single ton; let
not a weed grow, and the land will certainly improve.</p>

<p>The first object should be to destroy weeds. I&nbsp;do not know how
it is in other sections, but with us the majority of farms are
completely overrun with weeds. They are eating out the life of the land,
and if something is not done to destroy them, even exorbitantly high
prices can not make farming profitable. A&nbsp;farmer yesterday was
contending that it did not pay to summer-fallow. He has taken a run-down
farm, and a year ago last spring he plowed up ten acres of a field, and
sowed it to barley and oats. The remainder of the field he
summer-fallowed, plowing it four times, rolling and harrowing thoroughly
after each plowing. After
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
the barley and oats were off, he plowed the land once, harrowed it and
sowed Mediterranean wheat. On the summer-fallow he drilled in Diehl
wheat. He has just threshed, and got 22 bushels per acre of
Mediterranean wheat after the spring crop, at one plowing, and 26
bushels per acre of Diehl wheat on the summer-fallow. This, he said,
would not pay, as it cost him $20 per acre to summer-fallow, and he lost
the use of the land for one season. Now this may be all true, and yet it
is no argument against summer-fallowing. Wait a few years. Farming is
slow work. Mr. George Geddes remarked to me, when I told him I was
trying to renovate a run-down farm, “you will find it the work of your
life.” We ought not to expect a big crop on poor, run-down land, simply
by plowing it three or four times in as many months. Time is required
for the chemical changes to take place in the soil. But watch the effect
on the clover for the next two years, and when the land is plowed again,
see if it is not in far better condition than the part not
summer-fallowed. I&nbsp;should expect the clover on the summer-fallow to
be fully one-third better in quantity, and of better quality than on the
other part, and this extra quantity of clover will make an extra
quantity of good manure, and thus we have the means of going on with the
work of improving the farm.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Doctor, “and there will also be more clover-roots in
the soil.”</p>

<p>“But I can not afford to wait for clover, and summer-fallowing,”
writes an intelligent New York gentleman, a&nbsp;dear lover of good
stock, who has bought an exhausted New England farm, “I&nbsp;must have a
portion of it producing good crops right off.” Very well. A&nbsp;farmer
with plenty of money can do wonders in a short time. Set a gang of
ditchers to work, and put in underdrains where most needed. Have teams
and plows enough to do the work rapidly. As soon as the land is drained
and plowed, put on a heavy roller. Then sow 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano
per acre broadcast, or its equivalent in some other fertilizer. Follow
with a Shares’ harrow. This will mellow the surface and cover the guano
without disturbing the sod. Follow with a forty-toothed harrow, and roll
again, if needed, working the land until there is three or four inches
of fine, mellow surface soil. Then mark off the land in rows as straight
as an arrow, and plant corn. Cultivate thoroughly, and kill every weed.
If the ditchers can not get through until it is too late to plant corn,
drill in beans on the last drained part of the field.</p>

<p>Another good crop to raise on a stock farm is corn-fodder. This can
be drilled in from time to time as the land can be got
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
ready. Put on half a ton of guano per acre and harrow in, and then mark
off the rows three feet apart, and drill in four bushels of corn per
acre. Cultivate thoroughly, and expect a great crop. By the last of
July, the Ayrshire cows will take kindly to the succulent corn-fodder,
and with three or four quarts of meal a day, it will enable each of them
to make 10 lbs. of butter a week.</p>

<p>For the pigs, sow a few acres of peas. These will do well on
sod-land, sown early or late, or a part early and a part late, as most
convenient. Sow broadcast and harrow in, 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano per
acre and 200 lbs. of gypsum. Drill in three bushels of peas per acre, or
sow broadcast, and cover them with a Shares’ harrow. Commence to feed
the crop green as soon as the pods are formed, and continue to feed out
the crop, threshed or unthreshed, until the middle of November. Up to
this time the bugs do comparatively little damage. The pigs will thrive
wonderfully on this crop, and make the richest and best of manure.</p>

<p>I have little faith in any attempt to raise root crops on land not
previously well prepared. But as it is necessary to have some
mangel-wurzel and Swede turnips for the Ayrshire cows and long-wool
sheep next winter and spring, select the cleanest and richest land that
can be found that was under cultivation last season. If fall plowed, the
chances of success will be doubled. Plow the land two or three times,
and cultivate, harrow, and roll until it is as mellow as a garden. Sow
400 lbs. of Peruvian guano and 300 lbs. of good superphosphate per acre
broadcast, and harrow them in. Ridge up the land into ridges 2½ to 3 ft.
apart, with a double mould-board plow. Roll down the ridges with a light
roller, and drill in the seed. Sow the mangel-wurzel in May&mdash;the
earlier the better&mdash;and the Swedes as soon afterwards as the land
can be thoroughly prepared. Better delay until June rather than sow on
rough land.</p>

<p>The first point on such a farm will be to attend to the grass land.
This affords the most hopeful chance of getting good returns the first
year. But no time is to be lost. Sow 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano per acre
on all the grass land and on the clover, with 200 lbs. of gypsum in
addition on the latter. If this is sown early enough, so that the spring
rains dissolve it and wash it into the soil, great crops of grass may be
expected.</p>

<p>“But will it pay?” My friend in New York is a very energetic and
successful business man, and he has a real love for farming, and I have
no sort of doubt that, taking the New York business and the farm
together, they will afford a very handsome profit. Furthermore,
I&nbsp;have no doubt that if, after he has drained it, he
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
would cover the whole farm with 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano per acre, or
its equivalent, it would pay him better than any other agricultural
operation he is likely to engage in. By the time it was on the land the
cost would amount to about $20 per acre. If he sells no more grass or
hay from the farm than he would sell if he did not use the guano, this
$20 may very properly be added to the permanent capital invested in the
farm. And in this aspect of the case, I&nbsp;have no hesitation in
saying it will pay a high rate of interest. His bill for labor will be
as much in one case as in the other; and if he uses the guano he will
probably double his crops. His grass lands will carry twenty cows
instead of ten, and if he raises the corn-fodder and roots, he can
probably keep thirty cows better than he could otherwise keep a dozen;
and, having to keep a herdsman in either case, the cost of labor will
not be much increased. “But you think it will not pay?” It will probably
not pay <i>him</i>. I&nbsp;do not think <i>his</i> business would pay me
if I lived on my farm, and went to New York only once or twice a week.
If there is one business above all others that requires constant
attention, it is farming&mdash;and especially stock-farming. But my
friend is right in saying that he cannot afford to wait to enrich his
land by clover and summer-fallowing. His land costs too much; he has a
large barn and everything requisite to keep a large stock of cattle and
sheep. The interest on farm and buildings, and the money expended in
labor, would run on while the dormant matter in the soil was slowly
becoming available under the influence of good tillage. The large barn
must be filled at once, and the only way to do this is to apply manure
with an unsparing hand. If he lived on the farm, I&nbsp;should have no
doubt that, by adopting this course, and by keeping improved stock, and
feeding liberally, he could make money. Perhaps he can find a man who
will successfully manage the farm under his direction, but the
probabilities are that his present profit and pleasure will come from
the gratification of his early love for country life.</p>

<h5>WHAT IS MANURE?</h5>

<p>“What is the good of asking such a question as that?” said the
Deacon; “we all know what manure is.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” I replied, “tell us what it is?”</p>

<p>“<i>It is anything that will make crops grow better and bigger</i>,”
replied the Deacon.</p>

<p>“That is not a bad definition,” said I; “but let us see if it is a
true one. You have two rows of cabbage in the garden, and you water one
row, and the plants grow bigger and better. Is <i>water</i> manure? You
cover a plant with a hand-glass, and it grows bigger and better. Is a
hand-glass manure? You shelter a few plants, and they grow bigger and
better. Is shelter manure? You put some pure sand round a few plants,
and they grow bigger and better. Is pure sand manure? I think we shall
have to reject the Deacon’s definition.”</p>

<p>Let us hear what the Doctor has to say on the subject.</p>

<p>“Manure,” replied the Doctor, “is the <i>food of plants</i>.”</p>

<p>“That is a better definition,” said I; “but this is really not
answering the question. You say manure is plant-food. But what is
plant-food?”</p>

<p>“Plant-food,” said the Doctor, “is composed of twelve elements, and,
possibly, sometimes one or two more, which we need not here talk about.
Four of these elements are gases, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and
nitrogen. When a plant or animal is burnt, these gases are driven off.
The ashes which remain are composed of potash, soda, lime, and magnesia;
sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, chlorine, and silica. In other words,
the ‘food of plants’ is composed of four organic, or gaseous elements,
and eight inorganic, or mineral elements, of which four have acid and
four alkaline properties.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Doctor,” said the Deacon, “I&nbsp;am glad to know what
manure is. It is the food of plants, and the food of plants is composed
of four gases, four acid and four alkaline elements. I&nbsp;seem to know
all about it. All I have wanted to make my land rich was plenty of
manure, and now I shall know where to get it&mdash;oxygen, hydrogen,
carbon, and nitrogen; these four atmospheric elements. Then potash,
soda, magnesia, and lime. I&nbsp;know what these four are. Then sulphur,
phosphorous, silica
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
(sand,) and chlorine (salt). I&nbsp;shall soon have rich land and big
crops.”</p>

<p>Charley, who has recently come home from college, where he has been
studying chemistry, looked at the Deacon, and was evidently puzzled to
understand him. Turning to the Doctor, Charley asked modestly if what
the Doctor had said in regard to the composition of plant food could not
be said of the composition of all our animals and plants.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the Doctor, “all our agricultural plants and all
our animals, man included, are composed of these twelve elements,
oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen; phosphorus, sulphur, silica,
chlorine, potash, soda, magnesia, and lime.”</p>

<p>Charley said something about lime, potash, and soda, not being
“elements;” and something about silica and chlorine not being found in
animals.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “and he has left out <i>iron</i>, which is an
important constituent of all our farm crops and animals.” Neither the
Doctor nor the Deacon heard our remarks. The Deacon, who loves an
argument, exclaimed: “I&nbsp;thought I knew all about it. You told us
that manure was the food of plants, and that the food of plants was
composed of the above twelve elements; and now you tell us that man and
beast, fruit and flower, grain and grass, root, stem, and branch, all
are composed or made up of these same dozen elements. If I ask you what
bread is made of, you say it is composed of the dozen elements
aforesaid. If I ask what wheat-straw is made of, you answer, the
<i>dozen</i>. If I ask what a thistle is made of, you say the dozen.
There are a good many milk-weeds in my strawberry patch, and I am glad
to know that the milk-weed and the strawberry are both composed of the
same dozen elements. Manure is the food of plants, and the food of
plants is composed of the above dozen elements, and every plant and
animal that we eat is also composed of these same dozen elements, and so
I suppose there is no difference between an onion and an omelet, or
between bread and milk, or between mangel-wurzel and manure.”</p>

<p>“The difference,” replied the Doctor, “is one of proportion. Mangels
and manure are both composed of the same elements. In fact, mangels make
good manure, and good manure makes good mangels.”</p>

<p>The Deacon and the Doctor sat down to a game of backgammon, and
Charley and I continued the conversation more seriously.</p>

CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<h5>SOMETHING ABOUT PLANT-FOOD.</h5>

<p>“The Doctor is in the main correct,” said I; “but he does not fully
answer the question, ‘What is manure?’ To say that manure is plant-food,
does not cover the whole ground. All soils on which plants grow, contain
more or less plant-food. A&nbsp;plant can not create an atom of potash.
It can not get it from the atmosphere. We find potash in the plant, and
we know that it got it from the soil and we are certain, therefore, that
the soil contains potash. And so of all the other mineral elements of
plants. A&nbsp;soil that will produce a thistle, or a pig-weed, contains
plant-food. And so the definition of the Doctor is defective, inasmuch
as it makes no distinction between soil and manure. Both contain
plant-food.”</p>

<p>“What is your definition of manure?” asked Charley; “it would seem as
though we all knew what manure was. We have got a great heap of it in
the yard, and it is fermenting nicely.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “we are making more manure on the farm this winter
than ever before. Two hundred pigs, 120 large sheep, 8 horses, 11 cows,
and a hundred head of poultry make considerable manure; and it is a good
deal of work to clean out the pens, pile the manure, draw it to the
field, and apply it to the crops. We ought to know something about it;
but we might work among manure all our lives, and not know what manure
is. At any rate, we might not be able to define it accurately.
I&nbsp;will, however, try my hand at a definition.</p>

<p>“Let us assume that we have a field that is free from stagnant water
at all seasons of the year; that the soil is clean, mellow, and well
worked seven inches deep, and in good order for putting in a crop. What
the coming ‘<i>season</i>’ will be we know not. It may be what we call a
hot, dry summer, or it may be cool and moist, or it may be partly one
and partly the other. The ‘season’ is a great element of uncertainty in
all our farming calculations; but we know that we shall have a season of
some kind. We have the promise of seed-time and harvest, and we have
never known the promise to fail us. Crops, however, vary very much,
according to the season; and it is necessary to bear this fact in mind.
Let us say that the sun and heat, and rain and dews, or what we call
‘the season,’ is capable of producing 50 bushels of wheat per acre, but
that the soil I have described above, does not produce over 20 bushels
per acre. There is no mechanical defect in the soil. The seed is good,
it is put in properly, and at the right time,
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
and in the best manner. No weeds choke the wheat plants or rob them of
their food; but that field does not produce as much wheat by 30 bushels
per acre as the <i>season</i> is capable of producing. Why? The answer
is evident. <i>Because the wheat plants do not find food enough in the
soil.</i> Now, anything that will furnish this food, anything that will
cause that field to produce what the climate or season is capable of
producing, is manure. A&nbsp;gardener may increase his crops by
artificial heat, or by an increased supply of water, but this is not
manure. The effect is due to improved climatic conditions. It has
nothing to do with the question of manure. We often read in the
agricultural papers about ‘<i>shade</i> as manure.’ We might just as
well talk about <i>sunlight</i> as ‘manure.’ The effects observed should
be referred to modifications of the climate or season; and so in regard
to mulching. A&nbsp;good mulch may often produce a larger increase of
growth than an application of manure. But mulch, proper, is not manure.
It is climate. It checks evaporation of moisture from the soil. We might
as well speak of rain as manure as to call a mulch manure. In fact, an
ordinary shower in summer is little more than a mulch. It does not reach
the roots of plants; and yet we see the effect of the shower immediately
in the increased vigor of the plants. They are full of sap, and the
drooping leaves look refreshed. We say the rain has revived them, and so
it has; but probably not a particle of the rain has entered into the
circulation of the plant. The rain checked evaporation from the soil and
from the leaves. A&nbsp;cool night refreshes the plants, and fills the
leaves with sap, precisely in the same way. All these fertilizing
effects, however, belong to climate. It is inaccurate to associate
either mulching, sunshine, shade, heat, dews, or rain, with the question
of manure, though the effect may in certain circumstances be precisely
the same.”</p>

<p>Charley evidently thought I was wandering from the point. “You think,
then,” said he, “manure is <i>plant-food that the soil needs?</i>”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “that is a very good definition&mdash;very good,
indeed, though not absolutely accurate, because manure is manure,
whether a particular soil needs it or not.” Unobserved by us, the Deacon
and the Doctor had been listening to our talk. &mdash;“I&nbsp;would
like,” said the Deacon, “to hear you give a better definition than
Charley has given.” &mdash;“Manure,” said I, “is anything containing an
element or elements of plant-food, which, if the soil needed it, would,
if supplied in sufficient quantity, and in an available condition,
produce, according to soil, season, climate, and variety, a&nbsp;maximum
crop.”</p>

CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h5>NATURAL MANURE.</h5>

<p>We often hear about “natural” manure. I&nbsp;do not like the term,
though I believe it originated with me. It is not accurate; not definite
enough.</p>

<p>“I do not know what you mean by natural manure,” said the Deacon,
“unless it is the droppings of animals.” &mdash;“To distinguish them,
I&nbsp;suppose,” said the Doctor, “from artificial manures, such as
superphosphate, sulphate of ammonia, and nitrate of soda.” &mdash;“No;
that is not how I used the term. A&nbsp;few years ago, we used to hear
much in regard to the ‘exhaustion of soils.’ I thought this phrase
conveyed a wrong idea. When new land produces large crops, and when,
after a few years, the crops get less and less, we were told that the
farmers were exhausting their land. I&nbsp;said, no; the farmers are not
exhausting the <i>soil</i>; they are merely exhausting the accumulated
plant-food in the soil. In other words, they are using up the <i>natural
manure</i>.</p>

<p>“Take my own farm. Fifty years ago, it was covered with a heavy
growth of maple, beech, black walnut, oak, and other trees. These trees
had shed annual crops of leaves for centuries. The leaves rot on the
ground; the trees also, age after age. These leaves and other organic
matter form what I have called natural manure. When the land is cleared
up and plowed, this natural manure decays more rapidly than when the
land lies undisturbed; precisely as a manure-pile will ferment and decay
more rapidly if turned occasionally, and exposed to the air. The plowing
and cultivating renders this natural manure more readily available. The
leaves decompose, and furnish food for the growing crop.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">EXHAUSTION OF THE SOIL.</h6>

<p>“You think, then,” said the Doctor, “that when a piece of land is
cleared of the forest, harrowed, and sown to wheat; plowed and planted
to corn, and the process repeated again and again, until the land no
longer yields profitable crops, that it is the ‘natural manure,’ and not
the soil, that is exhausted?”</p>

<p>“I think the <i>soil</i>, at any rate, is not exhausted, and I can
easily conceive of a case where even the natural manure is very far from
being all used up.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” asked the Deacon, “is the land so poor that it will
scarcely support a sheep to the acre?”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
“Simply because the natural manure and other plant-food which the soil
contains is not in an available condition. It lies dead and inert. It is
not soluble, and the roots of the plants cannot get enough of it to
enable them to thrive; and in addition to this, you will find as a
matter of fact that these poor ‘exhausted’ farms are infested with
weeds, which rob the growing crops of a large part of the scanty supply
of available plant-food.”</p>

<p>“But these weeds,” said the Deacon, “are not removed from the farm.
They rot on the land; nothing is lost.”</p>

<p>“True,” said I, “but they, nevertheless, rob the growing crops of
available plant-food. The annual supply of plant-food, instead of being
used to grow useful plants, is used to grow weeds.”</p>

<p>“I understand that,” said the Deacon, “but if the weeds are left on
the land, and the useful plants are sold, the farmer who keeps his land
clean would exhaust his land faster than the careless farmer who lets
his land lie until it is overrun with thistles, briars, and pig-weed.
You agricultural writers, who are constantly urging us to farm better
and grow larger crops, seem to overlook this point. As you know,
I&nbsp;do not take much stock in chemical theories as applied to
agriculture, but as you do, here is a little extract I cut from an
agricultural paper, that seems to prove that the better you work your
land, and the larger crops you raise, the sooner you exhaust your
land.”</p>

<p>The Deacon put on his spectacles, drew his chair nearer the lamp on
the table, and read the following:</p>

<p>“There is, on an average, about one-fourth of a pound of potash to
every one hundred pounds of soil, and about one-eighth of a pound of
phosphoric acid, and one-sixteenth of a pound of sulphuric acid. If the
potatoes and the tops are continually removed from the soil, it will
soon exhaust the potash. If the wheat and straw are removed, it will
soon exhaust the phosphate of lime; if corn and the stalks, it will soon
exhaust the sulphuric acid. Unless there is a rotation, or the material
the plant requires is supplied from abroad, your crops will soon run
out, though the soil will continue rich for other plants.”</p>

<p>“That extract,” said I, “carries one back twenty-five years. We used
to have article after article in this strain. We were told that ‘always
taking meal out of the tub soon comes to the bottom,’ and always taking
potash and phosphoric acid from the soil will soon exhaust the supply.
But, <i>practically</i>, there is really little danger of our exhausting
the land. It does not pay. The farmer’s resources will be exhausted long
before he can exhaust his farm.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
“Assuming,” said the Doctor, who is fond of an argument, “that the above
statement is true, let us look at the facts. An acre of soil, 12 inches
deep, would weigh about 1,600 tons; and if, as the writer quoted by the
Deacon states, the soil contains 4 ozs. of potash in every 100 lbs. of
soil, it follows that an acre of soil, 12 inches deep, contains 8,000
lbs. of potash. Now, potatoes contain about 20 per cent of dry matter,
and this dry matter contains say, 4 per cent of ash, half of which is
potash. It follows, therefore, that 250 bushels of potatoes contain
about 60 lbs. of potash. If we reckon that the tops contain 20 lbs.
more, or 80 lbs. in all, it follows that the acre of soil contains
potash enough to grow an <i>annual</i> crop of 250 bushels of potatoes
per acre for one hundred years.”</p>

<p>“I know farmers,” said Charley, “who do not get over 50 bushels of
potatoes per acre, and in that case the potash would last five hundred
years, as the weeds grown with the crop are left on the land, and do
not, according to the Deacon, exhaust the soil.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Charley,” said the Doctor. “Now let us see about the
phosphoric acid, of which the soil, according to the above statement,
contains only half as much as it contains of potash, or 4,000 lbs. per
acre.</p>

<p>“A crop of wheat of 30 bushels per acre,” continued the Doctor,
“contains in the grain about 26 lbs. of ash, and we will say that half
of this ash is phosphoric acid, or 13 lbs. Allowing that the straw,
chaff, etc., contain 7 lbs. more, we remove from the soil in a crop of
wheat of 30 bushels per acre, 20 lbs. of phosphoric acid, and so,
according to the above estimate, an acre of soil contains phosphoric
acid to produce annually a crop of wheat and straw of 30 bushels per
acre for <i>two hundred years</i>.</p>

<p>“The writer of the paragraph quoted by the Deacon,” continued the
Doctor, “selected the crops and elements best suited to his purpose, and
yet, according to his own estimate, there is sufficient potash and
phosphoric acid in the first 12 inches of the soil to enable us to raise
unusually large crops until the next Centennial in 1976.</p>

<p>“But let us take another view of the subject,” continued the Doctor.
“No intelligent farmer removes all the potatoes <i>and tops</i>, all the
wheat, straw, and chaff, or all the corn and stalks from his farm.
According to Dr. Salisbury, a&nbsp;crop of corn of 75 bushels per acre
removes from the soil 600 lbs. of ash, but the <i>grain</i> contains
only 46 lbs. The other 554 lbs. is contained in the stalks, etc., all of
which are usually retained on the farm. It follows
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26" id = "page26"> </a>
from this, that when only the grain is sold off the farm, it takes more
than thirteen crops to remove as much mineral matter from the soil as is
contained in the whole of one crop. Again, the ash of the grain contains
less than 3 per cent of sulphuric acid, so that the 46 lbs. of ash, in
75 bushels of corn, contains less than 1½ lbs. of sulphuric acid, and
thus, if an acre of soil contains 2,000 lbs. of sulphuric acid, we have
sufficient for an annual crop of 75 bushels per acre for fifteen hundred
years!</p>

<p>“As I said before,” continued the Doctor, “intelligent farmers seldom
sell their straw, and they frequently purchase and consume on the farm
nearly as much bran, shorts, etc., as is sent to market with the grain
they sell. In the ‘Natural History of New York,’ it is stated that an
acre of wheat in Western New York, of 30 bushels per acre, including
straw, chaff, etc., removes from the soil 144 lbs. of mineral matter.
Genesee wheat usually yields about 80 per cent. of flour. This flour
contains only 0.7 per cent of mineral matter, while fine middlings
contain 4 per cent; coarse middlings, 5½ per cent; shorts, 8 per cent,
and bran 8½ per cent of mineral matter or ash. It follows from this,
that out of the 144 lbs. of mineral matter in the crop of wheat, less
than 10 lbs. is contained in the flour. The remaining 134 lbs. is found
in the straw, chaff, bran, shorts, etc., which a good farmer is almost
sure to feed out on his farm. But even if the farmer feeds out none of
his wheat-bran, but sells it all with his wheat, the 30 bushels of wheat
remove from the soil only 26 lbs. of mineral matter; and it would take
more than five crops to remove as much mineral matter as one crop of
wheat and straw contains. Allowing that half the ash of wheat is
phosphoric acid, 30 bushels remove only 13 lbs. from the soil, and if
the soil contains 4,000 lbs., it will take three hundred and seven
crops, of 30 bushels each, to exhaust it.”</p>

<p>“That is to say,” said Charley, “if all the straw and chaff is
retained on the farm, and is returned to the land without loss of
phosphoric acid.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Doctor, “and if all the bran and shorts, etc., were
retained on the farm, it would take eight hundred crops to exhaust the
soil of phosphoric acid; and it is admitted that of all the elements of
plant-food, phosphoric acid is the one first to be exhausted from the
soil.”</p>

<p>I have sold some timothy hay this winter, and propose to do so
whenever the price suits. But some of my neighbors, who do not hesitate
to sell their own hay, think I ought not to do so, because I “write for
the papers”! It ought to satisfy them to know that I bring back 30 cwt.
of bran for every ton of hay I
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
sell. My rule is to sell nothing but wheat, barley, beans, potatoes,
clover-seed, apples, wool, mutton, beef, pork, and butter. Everything
else is consumed on the farm&mdash;corn, peas, oats, mustard, rape,
mangels, clover, straw, stalks, etc. Let us make a rough estimate of how
much is sold and how much retained on a hundred-acre farm, leaving out
the potatoes, beans, and live-stock. We have say:</p>

<p>It would take a good many years to exhaust any ordinary soil by such
a course of cropping. Except, perhaps, the sandy knolls, I&nbsp;think
there is not an acre on my farm that would be exhausted in ten thousand
years, and as some portions of the low alluvial soil will grow crops
without manure, there will be an opportunity to give the poor, sandy
knolls more than their share of plant-food. In this way, notwithstanding
the fact that we sell produce and bring nothing back, I&nbsp;believe the
whole farm will gradually increase in productiveness. The plant-food
annually rendered available from the decomposition and disintegration of
the inert organic and mineral matter in the soil, will be more than
equal to that exported from the farm. If the soil becomes deficient in
anything, it is likely that it will be in phosphates, and a little
superphosphate or bone-dust might at any rate be profitably used on the
rape, mustard, and turnips.</p>

<p>The point in good farming is to develop from the latent stores
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
in the soil, and to accumulate enough available plant-food for the
production of the largest possible yield of those crops which we sell.
In other words, we want enough available plant-food in the soil to grow
40 bushels of wheat and 50 bushels of barley. I&nbsp;think the farmer
who raises 10 tons for every ton he sells, will soon reach this point,
and when once reached, it is a comparatively easy matter to maintain
this degree of fertility.</p>


<h6 class = "section">WHY OUR CROPS ARE SO POOR.</h6>

<p>“If the soil is so rich in plant-food,” said the Deacon,
“I&nbsp;again ask, why are our crops so poor?”</p>

<p>The Deacon said this very quietly. He did not seem to know that he
had asked one of the most important questions in the whole range of
agricultural science. It is a fact that a soil may contain enough
plant-food to produce a thousand large crops, and yet the crops we
obtain from it may be so poor as hardly to pay the cost of cultivation.
The plant-food is there, but the plants cannot get at it. It is not in
an available condition; it is not soluble. A&nbsp;case is quoted by
Prof. Johnson, where a soil was analyzed, and found to contain to the
depth of one foot 4,652 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, but only 63 lbs. of
this was in an available condition. And this is equally true of
phosphoric acid, potash, and other elements of plant-food. No matter how
much plant-food there may be in the soil, the only portion that is of
any immediate value is the small amount that is annually available for
the growth of crops.</p>


<h6 class = "section">HOW TO GET LARGER CROPS.</h6>

<p>“I am tired of so much talk about plant-food,” said the Deacon; “what
we want to know is how to make our land produce larger crops of wheat,
corn, oats, barley, potatoes, clover, and grass.”</p>

<p>This is precisely what I am trying to show. On my own farm, the three
leading objects are (1) to get the land drained, (2) to make it clean
and mellow, and (3) to get available nitrogen for the cereal crops.
After the first two objects are accomplished, the measure of
productiveness will be determined by the amount of available nitrogen in
the soil. How to get available nitrogen, therefore, is my chief and
ultimate object in all the operations on the farm, and it is here that
science can help me. I&nbsp;know how to get nitrogen, but I want to get
it in the cheapest way, and then to be sure that I do not waste it.</p>

<p>There is one fact fully established by repeated experiment and
general experience&mdash;that 80 lbs. of available nitrogen per acre,
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29" id = "page29"> </a>
applied in manure, will almost invariably give us a greatly increased
yield of grain crops. I&nbsp;should expect, on my farm, that on land
which, without manure, would give me 15 bushels of wheat per acre, such
a dressing of manure would give me, in a favorable season, 35 or 40
bushels per acre, with a proportional increase of straw; and, in
addition to this, there would be considerable nitrogen left for the
following crop of clover. Is it not worth while making an earnest effort
to get this 80 lbs. of available nitrogen?</p>

<p>I have on my farm many acres of low, mucky land, bordering on the
creek, that probably contain several thousand pounds of nitrogen per
acre. So long as the land is surcharged with water, this nitrogen, and
other plant-food, lies dormant. But drain it, and let in the air, and
the oxygen decomposes the organic matter, and ammonia and nitric acid
are produced. In other words, we get <i>available</i> nitrogen and other
plant-food, and the land becomes capable of producing large crops of
corn and grass; and the crops obtained from this low, rich land, will
make manure for the poorer, upland portions of the farm.</p>

<h5>SWAMP-MUCK OR PEAT AS MANURE.</h5>

<p>“It would pay you,” said the Deacon, “to draw out 200 or 300 loads of
muck from the swamp every year, and compost it with your manure.”</p>

<p>This may or may not be the case. It depends on the composition of the
muck, and how much labor it takes to handle it.</p>

<p>“What you should do,” said the Doctor, “is to commence at the creek,
and straighten it. Take a gang of men, and be with them with yourself,
or get a good foreman to direct operations. Commence at <i>a</i>, and
straighten the creek to <i>b</i>, and from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i> (see map
on next page). Throw all the rich, black muck in a heap by itself,
separate from the sand. You, or your foreman, must be there, or you will
not get this done. A&nbsp;good ditcher will throw out a great mass of
this loose muck and sand in a day; and you want him to dig, not think.
You must do the thinking, and tell him which is muck, and which is only
sand and dirt. When thrown up, this muck, in our dry, hot climate, will,
in the course of a few
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
months, part with a large amount of water, and it can then be drawn to
the barns and stables, and used for bedding, or for composting with
manure. Or if you do not want to draw it to the barn, get some refuse
lime from the lime-kiln, and mix it with the muck after it has been
thrown up a few weeks, and is partially dry. Turn over the heap, and put
a few bushels of lime to every cord of the muck, mixing the lime and
muck together, leaving the heap in a compact form, and in good shape, to
shed the rain.</p>

<p>“When you have straightened, and cleaned out, and deepened the
creek,” continued the Doctor, “commence at <i>z</i> on the new creek,
and cut a ditch through the swamp to <i>y</i>. Throw the muck on one
side, and the sand on the other. This will give you some good, rich
muck, and at the same time drain your swamp. Then cut some
<i>under-drains</i> from <i>y</i> towards the higher land at <i>w</i>,
<i>v</i>, and <i>h</i>, and from <i>f</i> to <i>x</i>. These will drain
your land, and set free the inert plant-food, and such crops of timothy
as you will get from this swamp will astonish the natives, and your bill
for medical attendance and quinine will sink to zero.”</p>

</p>

<p>The Doctor is right. There is money and health in the plan.</p>

<p>Prof. S.&nbsp;W. Johnson, as chemist to the Conn. State Ag. Society,
made accurate analyses of 33 samples of peat and muck sent him by
gentlemen from different parts of the State. The amount of
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
potential ammonia in the chemically dry peat was found to vary from 0.58
in the poorest, to 4.06 per cent in the richest samples. In other words,
one deposit of muck may contain seven times as much nitrogen as another,
and it would be well before spending much money in drawing out muck for
manure to send a sample of it to some good chemist. A&nbsp;bed of
swamp-muck, easily accessible, and containing 3 per cent of nitrogen,
would be a mine of wealth to any farmer. One ton of such muck, dry,
would contain more nitrogen than 7 tons of straw.</p>

<p>“It would be capital stuff,” said the Deacon, “to put in your
pig-pens to absorb the urine. It would make rich manure.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said I, “and the weak point in my pig-breeding is the
want of sufficient straw. Pigs use up more bedding than any other
animals. I&nbsp;have over 200 pigs, and I could use a ton of dry muck to
each pig every winter to great advantage. The pens would be drier, the
pigs healthier, and the manure richer.”</p>

<p>The Doctor here interrupted us. “I&nbsp;see,” said he, “that the
average amount of ammonia in the 33 samples of dry peat analyzed by
Professor Johnson is 2.07 per cent. I&nbsp;had no idea that muck was so
rich. Barn-yard manure, or the manure from the horse stables in the
cities, contains only half a per cent (0.5) of ammonia, and it is an
unusually rich manure that contains one per cent. We are safe in saying
that a ton of dry muck, on the average, contains at least twice as much
potential ammonia as the average of our best and richest
stable-manure.”</p>

<h4 class = "section extended"><a name = "chapVI" id = "chapVI">
CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<h5>WHAT IS POTENTIAL AMMONIA?</h5>

<p>“You say,” said the Deacon, “that dry muck contains twice as much
‘<i>potential ammonia</i>’ as manure?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Doctor, “it contains three or four times as much as
the half-rotted straw and stalks you call manure.”</p>

<p>“But what do you mean,” asked the Deacon, “by ‘<i>potential</i>
ammonia?’”</p>

<p>“It is a term,” said the Doctor, “we used to hear much more
frequently than we do now. Ammonia is composed of 14 lbs. of nitrogen
and 3 lbs. of hydrogen; and if, on analysis, a&nbsp;guano or
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
other manure was found to contain, in whatever form, 7 per cent of
nitrogen, the chemist reported that he found in it 8½ per cent of
‘potential’ ammonia. Dried blood contains no ammonia, but if it
contained 14 per cent of nitrogen, the chemist would be justified in
saying it contained 17 per cent of potential ammonia, from the fact that
the dried blood, by fermentation, is capable of yielding this amount of
ammonia. We say a ton of common horse-manure contains 10 or 12 lbs. of
potential ammonia. If perfectly fresh, it may not contain a particle of
ammonia; but it contains nitrogen enough to produce, by fermentation, 10
or 12 lbs. of ammonia. And when it is said that dry swamp-muck contains,
on the average, 2.07 per cent of potential ammonia, it simply means that
it contains nitrogen enough to produce this amount of ammonia. In point
of fact, I&nbsp;suppose muck, when dug fresh from the swamp, contains no
ammonia. Ammonia is quite soluble in water, and if there was any ammonia
in the swamp-muck, it would soon be washed out. The nitrogen, or
‘potential ammonia,’ in the muck exists in an inert, insoluble form, and
before the muck will yield up this nitrogen to plants, it is necessary,
in some way, to ferment or decompose it. But this is a point we will
discuss at a future meeting.”</p>

CHAPTER VII.</a></h4>

<h5>TILLAGE IS MANURE.</h5>

<p>The Doctor has been invited to deliver a lecture on manure before our
local Farmers’ Club. “The etymological meaning of the word manure,” he
said, “is <i>hand labor</i>, from <i>main</i>, hand, and <i>ouvrer</i>,
to work. To manure the land originally meant to cultivate it, to hoe, to
dig, to plow, to harrow, or stir it in any way so as to expose its
particles to the oxygen of the atmosphere, and thus render its latent
elements assimilable by plants.</p>

<p>“When our first parent,” he continued, “was sent forth from the
Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken, he probably
did not know that the means necessary to kill the thorns and thistles
enhanced the productiveness of the soil, yet such was undoubtedly the
case.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<a name = "page33" id = "page33"> </a>
“The farmer for centuries was simply a ‘tiller of the ground.’ Guano,
though formed, according to some eminent authorities, long ages before
the creation of man, was not then known. The coprolites lay undisturbed
in countless numbers in the lias, the greensand, and the Suffolk crag.
Charleston phosphates were unknown. Superphosphate, sulphate of ammonia,
nitrate of soda, and kainit were not dreamed of. Nothing was said about
the mineral manure theory, or the exhaustion of the soil. There were no
frauds in artificial fertilizers; no Experiment Stations. The earth,
fresh from the hands of its Creator, needed only to be ‘tickled with a
hoe to laugh with a harvest.’ Nothing was said about the value of the
manure obtained from the consumption of a ton of oil-cake, or
malt-combs, or bran, or clover-hay. For many centuries, the hoe, the
spade, and the rake constituted Adam’s whole stock in trade.</p>

<p>“At length,” continued the Doctor, “a great discovery was made.
A&nbsp;Roman farmer&mdash;probably a prominent Granger&mdash;stumbled on
a mighty truth. Manuring the land&mdash;that is, hoeing and cultivating
it&mdash;increased its fertility. This was well known&mdash;had been
known for ages, and acted upon; but this Roman farmer, Stercutius, who
was a close observer, discovered that the <i>droppings of animals</i>
had the same effect as hoeing. No wonder these idolatrous people voted
him a god. They thought there would be no more old-fashioned manuring;
no more hoeing.</p>

<p>“Of course they were mistaken,” continued the Doctor, “our arable
land will always need plowing and cultivating to kill weeds. Manure, in
the sense in which we now use the term, is only a partial substitute for
tillage, and tillage is only a partial substitute for manure; but it is
well to bear in mind that the words mean the same thing, and the effects
of both are, to a certain extent, identical. Tillage is manure, and
manure is tillage.”</p>

CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>

<h5>SUMMER-FALLOWING.</h5>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the merits, or demerits, of
fallowing. But an intelligent Ohio farmer writes me: &mdash;“I&nbsp;see
that you recommend fallow plowing, what are your reasons? Granting that
the <i>immediate</i> result is an increased crop, is not the land
impoverished? Will not the thorough cultivation of corn, or potatoes,
answer as well?” And a distinguished farmer, of this State, in a recent
communication expressed the same idea&mdash;that summer-fallowing would
soon impoverish the land. But if this is the case, the fault is not in
the practice of summer-fallowing, but in growing too many grain crops,
and selling them, instead of consuming them on the farm. Take two
fields; summer-fallow one, and sow it to wheat. Plant the other to corn,
and sow wheat after it in the fall. You get, say 35 bushels of wheat per
acre from the summer-fallow. From the other field you get, say, 30
bushels of shelled corn per acre, and 10 bushels of wheat afterwards.
Now, where a farmer is in the habit of selling all his wheat, and
consuming all his corn on the farm, it is evident that the practice of
summer-fallowing will impoverish the soil more rapidly than the system
of growing corn followed by wheat&mdash;and for the simple reason that
more wheat is sold from the farm. If no more grain is sold in one case
than in the other, the summer-fallowing will not impoverish the soil any
more than corn growing.</p>

<p>My idea of fallowing is this:&mdash;The soil and the atmosphere
furnish, on good, well cultivated land, plant-food sufficient, say, for
15 bushels of wheat per acre, <i>every year</i>. It will be sometimes
more, and sometimes less, according to the season and the character of
the soil, but on good, strong limestone land this may be taken as about
the average. To grow wheat every year in crops of 15 bushels per acre,
would impoverish the soil just as much as to summer-fallow and get 30
bushels of wheat every other year. It is the same thing in either case.
But in summer-fallowing, we clean the land, and the <i>profits</i> from
a crop of 30 bushels per acre every other year, are much more than from
two crops of 15 bushels every year. You know that Mr. Lawes has a field
of about thirteen acres that he sows with wheat every year. On the plot
that receives no manure of any kind, the crop, for twenty years,
averaged 16¼ bushels per acre. It is plowed twice every year, and
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<a name = "page35" id = "page35"> </a>
the wheat is hand-hoed in the spring to keep it clean. A&nbsp;few years
ago, in a field adjoining this experimental wheat field, and that is of
the same character of land, he made the following experiment. The land,
after wheat, was fallowed, and then sown to wheat; then fallowed the
next year, and again sown to wheat, and the next year it was sown to
wheat after wheat. The following is the result compared with the yield
of the continuously unmanured plot in the experimental field that is
sown to wheat every year:</p>

<p>Taking the first four years, we have a total yield from the plot sown
every year of 66 bushels 2¼ pecks, and from the two crops alternately
fallowed, a&nbsp;total yield of 79 bushels. The next year, when wheat
was sown after wheat on the land previously fallowed, the yield was
almost identical with the yield from the plot that has grown wheat after
wheat for so many years.</p>

<p>So far, these results do not indicate any exhaustion from the
practice of fallowing. On the other hand, they tend to show that we can
get <i>more</i> wheat by sowing it every other year, than by cropping it
every year in succession. The reason for this may be found in the fact
that in a fallow the land is more frequently exposed to the atmosphere
by repeated plowings and harrowings; and it should be borne in mind that
the effect of stirring the land is not necessarily in proportion to the
total amount of stirring, but is according to the number of times that
fresh particles of soil are exposed to the atmosphere. Two plowings and
two harrowings in one week, will not do as much good as two plowings and
two harrowings, at different times in the course of three or four
months. It is for this reason that I object, theoretically, to sowing
wheat after barley. We often plow the barley stubble twice, and spend
considerable labor in getting the land into good condition; but it is
generally all done in the course of ten days or two weeks. We do not get
any adequate benefit for this labor. We can kill weeds readily at this
season, (August), but the stirring of the soil does not develope the
latent plant-food to the extent it would if the
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
work was not necessarily done in such a limited period. I&nbsp;say
<i>theoretically</i>, for in point of fact I <i>do</i> sow wheat after
barley. I&nbsp;do so because it is very convenient, and because it is
more immediately profitable. I&nbsp;am satisfied, however, that <i>in
the end</i> it would be more profitable to seed down the barley with
clover.</p>

<p>We <i>must</i> raise larger crops; and to do this we must raise them
less frequently. This is the key-note of the coming improved system of
American agriculture, in all sections where good land is worth less than
one hundred dollars per acre. In the neighborhood of large cities, and
wherever land commands a high price, we must keep our farms in a high
state of fertility by the purchase of manures or cattle foods. Those of
us in the interior, where we can not buy manure, must raise fewer grain
crops, and more clover. We must aim to raise 40 bushels of wheat, 50
bushels of barley, 80 bushels of oats, and 100 bushels of shelled corn,
and 5 bushels of clover-seed per acre. That this can be done on good,
well-drained land, from the unaided resources of the farm, I&nbsp;have
no doubt. It may give us no more grain to sell than at present, but it
will enable us to produce much more mutton, wool, beef, cheese, butter,
and pork, than at present.</p>

<p>“But, then, will there be a demand for the meat, wool, etc.?” The
present indications are highly favorable. But we must aim to raise
<i>good</i> meat. The low-priced beef and mutton sold in our markets are
as unprofitable to the consumer as they are to the producer. We must
feed higher, and to do this to advantage we must have improved stock.
There is no profit in farming without good tillage, larger crops,
improved stock, and higher feeding. The details will be modified by
circumstances, but the principles are the same wherever
agri-<i>culture</i> is practised.</p>

<h5>HOW TO RESTORE A WORN-OUT FARM.</h5>

<p>I have never yet seen a “worn-out” or “exhausted farm.” I know many
farms that are “run down.” I bought just such a farm a dozen or more
years ago, and I have been trying hard, ever since, to bring it up to a
profitable standard of productiveness&mdash;and am still trying, and
expect to have to keep on trying so long as I keep on farming. The truth
is, there never was a farm so rich, that the farmer did not wish it was
richer.</p>

<p>I have succeeded in making the larger part of my farm much more
productive than it ever was before, since it was cleared from the
original forest. But it is far from being as rich as I want it. The
truth is, God sent us into this world to work, and He has given us
plenty to do, if we will only do it. At any rate, this is true of
farming. He has not given us land ready to our hand. The man who first
cleared up my farm, had no easy task. He fairly earned all the good
crops he ever got from it. I&nbsp;have never begrudged him one particle
of the “natural manure” he took out of the land, in the form of wheat,
corn, oats, and hay. On the dry, sandy knolls, he probably got out a
good portion of this natural manure, but on the wetter and heavier
portions of the farm, he probably did not get out one-hundredth part of
the natural manure which the land contained.</p>

<p>Now, when such a farm came into my possession, what was I to do with
it?</p>

<p>“Tell us what you did,” said the Doctor, “and then, perhaps, we can
tell you what you ought to have done, and what you ought to have left
undone.”</p>

<p>“I made many mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said the Deacon; “I am glad to hear you acknowledge it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Doctor, “it is better to make mistakes in trying to
do something, than to hug our self-esteem, and fold our hands in
indolence. It has been said that critics are men who have failed in
their undertakings. But I rather think the most disagreeable, and
self-satisfied critics, are men who have never done anything, or tried
to do anything, themselves.”</p>

<p>The Deacon, who, though something of an old fogy, is a good deal of a
man, and possessed of good common sense, and much
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38" id = "page38"> </a>
experience, took these remarks kindly. “Well,” said he to me,
“I&nbsp;must say that your farm has certainly improved, but you did
things so differently from what we expected, that we could not see what
you were driving at.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you what I have been aiming at all along. 1st. To drain
the wet portions of the arable land. 2d. To kill weeds, and make the
soil mellow and clean. 3d. To make more manure.”</p>

<p>“You have also bought some bone-dust, superphosphate, and other
artificial manures.”</p>

<p>“True; and if I had had more money I would have bought more manure.
It would have paid well. I&nbsp;could have made my land as rich as it is
now in half the time.”</p>

<p>I had to depend principally on the natural resources of the land.
I&nbsp;got out of the soil all I could, and kept as much of it as
possible on the farm. One of the mistakes I made was, in breaking up too
much land, and putting in too much wheat, barley, oats, peas, and corn.
It would have been better for my pocket, though possibly not so good for
the farm, if I had left more of the land in grass, and also, if I had
summer-fallowed more, and sown less barley and oats, and planted less
corn.</p>

<p>“I do not see how plowing up the grass land,” said the Deacon, “could
possibly be any better for the farm. You agricultural writers are always
telling us that we plow too much land, and do not raise grass and clover
enough.”</p>

<p>“What I meant by saying that it would have been better for my pocket,
though possibly not so good for the farm, if I had not plowed so much
land, may need explanation. The land had been only half cultivated, and
was very foul. The grass and clover fields did not give more than half a
crop of hay, and the hay was poor in quality, and much of it half
thistles, and other weeds. I&nbsp;plowed this land, planted it to corn,
and cultivated it thoroughly. But the labor of keeping the corn clean
was costly, and absorbed a very large slice of the profits. <i>But</i>
the corn yielded a far larger produce per acre than I should have got
had the land lain in grass. And as all this produce was consumed on the
farm, we made more manure than if we had plowed less land.”</p>

<p>I have great faith in the benefits of thorough tillage&mdash;or, in
other words, of breaking up, pulverizing, and exposing the soil to the
decomposing action of the atmosphere. I&nbsp;look upon a good, strong
soil as a kind of storehouse of plant-food. But it is not an easy matter
to render this plant-food soluble. If it were any less soluble than it
is, it would have all leached out of the land centuries ago. Turning
over, and fining a manure-heap, if other conditions
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
are favorable, cause rapid fermentation with the formation of carbonate
of ammonia, and other soluble salts. Many of our soils, to the depth of
eight or ten inches, contain enough nitrogenous matter in an acre to
produce two or three thousand pounds of ammonia. By stirring the soil,
and exposing it to the atmosphere, a&nbsp;small portion of this nitrogen
becomes annually available, and is taken up by the growing crops. And it
is so with the other elements of plant-food. Stirring the soil, then, is
the basis of agriculture. It has been said that we must return to the
soil as much plant-food as we take from it. If this were true, nothing
could be sold from the farm. What we should aim to do, is to develop as
much as possible of the plant-food that lies latent in the soil, and not
to sell in the form of crops, cheese, wool, or animals, any more of this
plant-food than we annually develop from the soil. In this way the
“condition” of the soil would remain the same. If we sell <i>less</i>
than we develop, the condition of the soil will improve.</p>

<p>By “condition,” I mean the amount of <i>available</i> plant-food in
the soil. Nearly all our farms are poorer in plant-food to-day than when
first cleared of the original forest, or than they were ten, fifteen, or
twenty years later. In other words, the plants and animals that have
been sold from the farm, have carried off a considerable amount of
plant-food. We have taken far more nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash,
etc., out of the soil, than we have returned to it in the shape of
manure. Consequently, the soil must contain less and less of plant-food
every year. And yet, while this is a self-evident fact, it is,
nevertheless, true that many of these self-same farms are more
productive now than when first cleared, or at any rate more productive
than they were twenty-five or thirty years ago.</p>

<p>Sometime ago, the Deacon and I visited the farm of Mr. Dewey, of
Monroe Co., N.Y. He is a good farmer. He does not practice “high
farming” in the sense in which I use that term. His is a good example of
what I term slow farming. He raises large crops, but comparatively few
of them. On his farm of 300 acres, he raises 40 acres of wheat, 17 acres
of Indian corn, and 23 acres of oats, barley, potatoes, roots, etc. In
other words, he has 80 acres in crops, and 220 acres in grass&mdash;not
permanent grass. He lets it lie in grass five, six, seven, or eight
years, as he deems best, and then breaks it up, and plants it to corn.
The land he intends to plant to corn next year, has been in grass for
seven years. He will put pretty much all his manure on this land. After
corn, it will be sown to oats, or barley; then sown to wheat, and seeded
down again. It will then lie in grass three, four, five, six, or seven
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>
years, until he needs it again for corn, etc. This is “slow farming,”
but it is also good farming&mdash;that is to say, it gives large yields
per acre, and a good return for the labor expended.</p>

<p>The soil of this farm is richer to-day in <i>available</i> plant-food
than when first cleared. It produces larger crops per acre.</p>

<p>Mr. D. called our attention to a fact that establishes this point. An
old fence that had occupied the ground for many years was removed some
years since, and the two fields thrown into one. Every time this field
is in crops, it is easy to see where the old fence was, by the short
straw and poor growth on this strip, as compared with the land on each
side which had been cultivated for years.</p>

<p>This is precisely the result that I should have expected. If Mr. D.
was a poor farmer&mdash;if he cropped his land frequently, did not more
than half-cultivate it, sold everything he raised, and drew back no
manure&mdash;I think the old fence-strip would have given the best
crops.</p>

<p>The strip of land on which the old fence stood in Mr. Dewey’s field,
contained <i>more</i> plant-food than the soil on either side of it. But
it was not available. It was not developed. It was latent, inert,
insoluble, crude, and undecomposed. It was so much dead capital. The
land on either side which had been cultivated for years, produced better
crops. Why? Simply because the stirring of the soil had developed
<i>more</i> plant-food than had been removed by the crops. If the
stirring of the soil developed 100 lbs. of plant-food a year, and only
75 lbs. were carried off in the crops&mdash;25 lbs. being left on the
land in the form of roots, stubble, etc.&mdash;the land, at the
expiration of 40 years, would contain, provided none of it was lost,
1,000 lbs. more <i>available</i> plant-food than the uncultivated strip.
On the other hand, the latter would contain 3,000 lbs. more actual
plant-food per acre than the land which had been cultivated&mdash;but it
is in an unavailable condition. It is dead capital.</p>

<p>I do not know that I make myself understood, though I would like to
do so, because I am sure there is no point in scientific farming of
greater importance. Mr. Geddes calls grass the “pivotal crop” of
American agriculture. He deserves our thanks for the word and the idea
connected with it. But I am inclined to think the <i>pivot</i> on which
our agriculture stands and rotates, lies deeper than this. The grass
crop creates nothing&mdash;developes nothing. The untilled and unmanured
grass lands of Herkimer County, in this State, are no richer to-day than
they were 50 years ago. The pastures of Cheshire, England, except those
that have been top-dressed with bones, or other manures, are no more
productive than
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
they were centuries back. Grass alone will not make rich land. It is a
good “savings bank.” It gathers up and saves plant-food from running to
waste. It pays a good interest, and is a capital institution. But the
real source of fertility must be looked for <i>in the stores of
plant-food lying dormant in the soil</i>. Tillage, underdraining, and
thorough cultivation, are the means by which we develop and render this
plant-food available. Grass, clover, peas, or any other crop consumed on
the farm, merely affords us the means of saving this plant-food and
making it pay a good interest.</p>

CHAPTER X.</a></h4>

<h5>HOW TO MAKE MANURE.</h5>

<p>If we have the necessary materials, it is not a difficult matter to
make manure; in fact, the manure will make itself. We sometimes need to
hasten the process, and to see that none of the fertilizing matter runs
to waste. This is about all that we can do. We cannot create an atom of
plant-food. It is ready formed to our hands; but we must know where to
look for it, and how to get it in the easiest, cheapest, and best way,
and how to save and use it. The science of manure-making is a profound
study. It is intimately connected with nearly every branch of
agriculture.</p>

<p>If weeds grow and decay on the land, they make manure. If we grow a
crop of buckwheat, or spurry, or mustard, or rape, or clover, and mow
it, and let it lie on the land, it makes manure; or if we plow it under,
it forms manure; or if, after it is mown, we rake up the green crop, and
put it into a heap, it will ferment, heat will be produced by the slow
combustion of a portion of the carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter, and
the result will be a mass of material, which we should all recognize as
“manure.” If, instead of putting the crop into a heap and letting it
ferment, we feed it to animals, the digestible carbonaceous and
nitrogenous matter will be consumed to produce animal heat and to
sustain the vital functions, and the refuse, or the solid and liquid
droppings of the animals, will be manure.</p>

<p>If the crop rots on the ground, nothing is added to it. If it
ferments, and gives out heat, in a heap, nothing is added to it. If it
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42" id = "page42"> </a>
is passed through an animal, and produces heat, nothing is added to
it.</p>

<p>I have heard people say a farmer could not make manure unless he kept
animals. We might with as much truth say a farmer cannot make ashes
unless he keeps stoves; and it would be just as sensible to take a lot
of stoves into the woods to make ashes, as it is to keep a lot of
animals merely to make manure. You can make the ashes by throwing the
wood into a pile, and burning it; and you can make the manure by
throwing the material out of which the manure is to be made into a pile,
and letting it ferment. On a farm where neither food nor manure of any
kind is purchased, the only way to make manure is to <i>get it out of
the land</i>.</p>

<p>“From the land and from the atmosphere,” remarked the Doctor. “Plants
get a large portion of the material of which they are composed from the
atmosphere.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “but it is principally carbonaceous matter, which
is of little or no value as manure. A&nbsp;small amount of ammonia and
nitric acid are also brought to the soil by rains and dews, and a
freshly-stirred soil may also sometimes absorb more or less ammonia from
the atmosphere; but while this is true, so far as making manure is
concerned, we must look to the plant-food existing in the soil
itself.</p>

<p>“Take such a farm as Mr. Dewey’s, that we have already referred to.
No manure or food has been purchased; or at any rate, not one-tenth as
much as has been sold, and yet the farm is more productive to-day than
when it was first cleared of the forest. He has developed the manure
from the stores of latent plant-food previously existing in the soil and
this is the way farmers generally make manure.”</p>

CHAPTER XI.</a></h4>

<h5>THE VALUE OF MANURE DEPENDS ON THE FOOD&mdash;NOT ON THE
ANIMAL.</h5>

<p>“If,” said I, “you should put a ton of cut straw in a heap, wet it,
and let it rot down into manure; and should place in another heap a ton
of cut corn-fodder, and in another heap a ton of cut clover-hay, wet
them, and let them also rot down into manure; and in another heap a ton
of pulped-turnips, and in another heap a ton of corn-meal, and in
another heap a ton of bran, and in another a ton of malt-sprouts, and
let them be mixed with water, and so treated that they will ferment
without loss of ammonia or other valuable plant-food, I&nbsp;think no
one will say that all these different heaps of manure will have the same
value. And if not, why not?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Charley, “the ton of straw does not contain as much
valuable plant-food as the ton of corn-fodder, nor the ton of
corn-fodder as much as the ton of clover-hay.”</p>

<p>“Now then,” said I, “instead of putting a ton of straw in one heap to
rot, and a ton of corn-fodder in another heap, and a ton of clover in
another heap, we feed the ton of straw to a cow, and the ton of
corn-fodder to another cow, and the ton of clover to another cow, and
save <i>all</i> the solid and liquid excrements, will the manure made
from the ton of straw be worth as much as the manure made from the ton
of corn-fodder or clover-hay?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Charley. &mdash;“Certainly not,” said the Doctor.
&mdash;“I&nbsp;am not so sure about it,” said the Deacon; “I&nbsp;think
you will get more manure from the corn-fodder than from the straw or
clover-hay.”</p>

<p>“We are not talking about bulk,” said the Doctor, “but value.<ins
class = "correction" title = "quotation marks as in original">”
“</ins>Suppose, Deacon,” said he, “you were to shut up a lot of your
Brahma hens, and feed them a ton of corn-meal, and should also feed a
ton of corn-meal made into slops to a lot of pigs, and should save
<i>all</i> the liquid and solid excrements from the pigs, and all the
manure from the hens, which would be worth the most?” &mdash;“The
hen-manure, of course,” said the Deacon, who has great faith in this
kind of “guano,” as he calls it.</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the Doctor, “you would probably not get more than
half a ton of manure from the hens, while the liquid and solid
excrements from the pigs, if the corn-meal was made into a thin slop,
would weigh two or three tons.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
“More, too,” said the Deacon, “the way you feed your store pigs.”</p>

<p>“Very well; and yet you say that the half ton of hen-manure made from
a ton of corn is worth more than the two or three tons of pig-manure
made from a ton of corn. You do not seem to think, after all, that mere
bulk or weight adds anything to the value of the manure. Why then should
you say that the manure from a ton of corn-fodder is worth more than
from a ton of straw, because it is more bulky?”</p>

<p>“You, yourself,” said the Deacon, “also say the manure from the ton
of corn-fodder is worth more than from the ton of straw.” &mdash;“True,”
said I “but <i>not</i> because it is more bulky. It is worth more
because the ton of corn-fodder contains a greater quantity of valuable
plant-food than the ton of straw. The clover is still richer in this
valuable plant-food, and the manure is much more valuable; in fact, the
manure from the ton of clover is worth as much as the manure from the
ton of straw and the ton of corn-fodder together.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see you prove that,” said the Deacon, “for if it is
true, I&nbsp;will sell no more clover-hay. I&nbsp;can’t get as much for
clover-hay in the market as I can for rye-straw.”</p>

<p>“I will not attempt to <i>prove</i> it at present,” said the Doctor;
“but the evidence is so strong and so conclusive that no rational man,
who will study the subject, can fail to be thoroughly convinced of its
truth.”</p>

<p>“The value of manure,” said I, “does not depend on the quantity of
water which it contains, or on the quantity of sand, or silica, or on
the amount of woody fibre or carbonaceous matter. These things add
little or nothing to its fertilizing value, except in rare cases; and
the sulphuric acid and lime are worth no more than the same quantity of
sulphate of lime or gypsum, and the chlorine and soda are probably worth
no more than so much common salt. The real chemical value of the manure,
other things being equal, is in proportion to the nitrogen, phosphoric
acid, and potash, that the manure contains.</p>

<p>“And the quantity of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash found in
the manure is determined, other things being equal, by the quantity of
the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash contained in the food consumed
by the animals making the manure.”</p>

The manure from a ton of undecorticated cotton-seed cake is worth
$15.74; that from a ton of cotton-seed, after being ground and sifted,
is worth $13.25. The grinding and sifting in Mr. Lawes’ experiments,
removed about 8 per cent of husk and cotton. Cotton-seed, so treated,
proved to be a very rich and economical food.</p>

<p class = "footnote">†
Middlings, Canielle.</p>

<p class = "footnote">‡
Shipstuff.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
Of all vegetable substances used for food, it will be seen that
decorticated cotton-seed cake is the richest in nitrogen, phosphoric
acid, and potash, and consequently makes the richest and most valuable
manure. According to Mr. Lawes’ estimate, the manure from a ton of
decorticated cotton-seed cake is worth $27.86 in gold.</p>

<p>Rape-cake comes next. Twenty-five to thirty years ago, rape-cake,
ground as fine as corn-meal, was used quite extensively on many of the
light-land farms of England as a manure for turnips, and not
unfrequently as a manure for wheat. Mr. Lawes used it for many years in
his experiments on turnips and on wheat.</p>

<p>Of late years, however, it has been fed to sheep and cattle. In other
words, it has been used, not as formerly, for manure alone, but for food
first, and manure afterwards. The oil and other carbonaceous matter
which the cake contains is of little value for manure, while it is of
great value as food. The animals take out this carbonaceous matter, and
leave nearly all the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash in the
manure. Farmers who had found it profitable to use on wheat and turnips
for manure alone, found it still more profitable to use it first for
food, and then for manure afterwards. Mr. Lawes, it will be seen,
estimates the manure produced from the consumption of a ton of rape-cake
at $21.01.</p>

<p>Linseed-oil cake comes next. Pure linseed-cake is exceedingly
valuable, both for food and manure. It is a favorite food with all
cattle and sheep breeders and feeders. It has a wonderful effect in
improving the appearance of cattle and sheep. An English farmer thinks
he cannot get along without “cake” for his calves, lambs, cattle, and
sheep. In this country, it is not so extensively used, except by the
breeders of improved stock. It is so popular in England that the price
is fully up to its intrinsic value, and not unfrequently other foods, in
proportion to the nutritive and manurial value, can be bought cheaper.
This fact shows the value of a good reputation. Linseed-cake, however,
is often adulterated, and farmers need to be cautious who they deal
with. When pure, it will be seen that the manure made by the consumption
of a ton of linseed-cake is worth $19.72.</p>

<p>Malt-dust stands next on the list. This article is known by different
names. In England, it is often called “malt-combs;” here it is known as
“malt-<i>sprouts</i>,” or “malt-<i>roots</i>.” In making barley into
malt, the barley is soaked in water, and afterwards kept in a warm room
until it germinates, and throws out sprouts and roots. It is then dried,
and before the malt is used, these dried sprouts and roots are sifted
out, and are sold for cattle-food. They weigh
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page47" id = "page47"> </a>
from 22 to 25 lbs. per bushel of 40 quarts. They are frequently mixed at
the breweries with the “grains,” and are sold to milkmen at the same
price&mdash;from 12 to 15 cents per bushel. Where their value is not
known, they can, doubtless, be sometimes obtained at a mere nominal
price. Milkmen, I&nbsp;believe, prefer the “grains” to the malt-dust.
The latter, however, is a good food for sheep. It has one advantage over
brewer’s “grains.” The latter contain 76 per cent of water, while the
malt-dust contains only 6 per cent of water. We can afford, therefore,
to transport malt-dust to a greater distance than the grains. We do not
want to carry <i>water</i> many miles. There is another advantage:
brewer’s grains soon ferment, and become sour; while the malt-dust,
being dry, will keep for any length of time. It will be seen that Mr.
Lawes estimates the value of the manure left from the consumption of a
ton of malt-dust at $18.21.</p>

<p>Tares or vetches, lentils, linseed or flaxseed, beans, wheat, bran,
middlings, fine mill-feed, undecorticated cotton-seed cake, peas, and
cotton-seed, stand next on the list. The value of these for manure
ranging from $13.25 to $16.75 per ton.</p>

<p>Then comes clover-hay. Mr. Lawes estimates the value of the manure
from the consumption of a ton of clover-hay at $9.64. This is from early
cut clover-hay.</p>

<p>When clover is allowed to grow until it is nearly out of flower, the
hay would not contain so much nitrogen, and would not be worth quite so
much per ton for manure. When mixed with timothy or other grasses, or
with weeds, it would not be so valuable. The above estimate is for the
average quality of good pure English clover-hay. Our best farmers raise
clover equally as good; but I have seen much clover-hay that certainly
would not come up to this standard. Still, even our common clover-hay
makes rich manure. In Wolff’s Table, given in the appendix, it will be
seen that clover-hay contains only 1.97 per cent of nitrogen and 5.7 per
cent of ash. Mr. Lawes’ clover contains more nitrogen and ash. This
means richer land and a less mature condition of the crop.</p>

<p>The cereal grains, wheat, barley, oats, and Indian corn, stand next
on the list, being worth from $6.32 to $7.70 per ton for manure.</p>

<p>“Meadow-hay,” which in the table is estimated as worth $6.43 per ton
for manure, is the hay from permanent meadows. It is a quite different
article from the “English Meadow-hay” of New England. It is, in fact,
the perfection of hay. The meadows are frequently top-dressed with
composted manure or artificial fertilizers,
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
and the hay is composed of a number of the best grasses, cut early and
carefully cured. It will be noticed, however, that even this choice
meadow-hay is not as valuable for manure as clover-hay.</p>

<p>English bean-straw is estimated as worth $3.87 per ton for manure.
The English “horse bean,” which is the kind here alluded to, has a very
stiff, coarse long straw, and looks as though it was much inferior as
fodder, to the straw of our ordinary white beans. See Wolff’s table in
the appendix.</p>

<p>Pea-straw is estimated at $3.74 per ton. When the peas are not
allowed to grow until dead ripe, and when the straw is carefully cured,
it makes capital food for sheep. Taking the grain and straw together, it
will be seen that peas are an unusually valuable crop to grow for the
purpose of making rich manure.</p>

<p>The straw of oats, wheat, and barley, is worth from $2.25 to $2.90
per ton. Barley straw being the poorest for manure, and oat straw the
richest.</p>

<p>Potatoes are worth $1.50 per ton, or nearly 5 cents a bushel for
manure.</p>

<p>The manurial value of roots varies from 80 cents a ton for carrots,
to $1.07 for mangel-wurzel, and $1.14 for parsnips.</p>

<p>I am very anxious that there should be no misapprehension as to the
meaning of these figures. I&nbsp;am sure they are well worth the careful
study of every intelligent farmer. Mr. Lawes has been engaged in making
experiments for over thirty years. There is no man more competent to
speak with authority on such a subject. The figures showing the money
value of the manure made from the different foods, are based on the
amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, which they contain. Mr.
Lawes has been buying and using artificial manures for many years, and
is quite competent to form a correct conclusion as to the cheapest
sources of obtaining nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. He has
certainly not overestimated their <i>cost</i>. They can not be bought at
lower rates, either in England or America. But of course it does not
follow from this that these manures are worth to the farmer the price
charged for them; that is a matter depending on many conditions. All
that can be said is, that if you are going to buy commercial manures,
you will have to pay at least as much for the nitrogen, phosphoric acid,
and potash, as the price fixed upon by Mr. Lawes. And you should
recollect that there are other ingredients in the manure obtained from
the food of animals, which are not estimated as of any value in the
table. For instance, there is a large amount of carbonaceous matter in
the manure of animals,
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
which, for some crops, is not without value, but which is not here taken
into account.</p>

<p>Viewed from a farmer’s stand-point, the table of money values must be
taken only in a comparative sense. It is not claimed that the manure
from a ton of wheat-straw is worth $2.68. This may, or may not, be the
case. But <i>if</i> the manure from a ton of wheat-straw is worth $2.08,
<i>then</i> the manure from a ton of pea-straw is worth $3.74, and the
manure from a ton of corn-meal is worth $6.65, and the manure from a ton
of clover-hay is worth $9.64, and the manure from a ton of wheat-bran is
worth $14.59. <i>If</i> the manure from a ton of corn meal is <i>not</i>
worth $6.65, then the manure from a ton of bran is not worth $14.59. If
the manure from the ton of corn is worth <i>more</i> than $6.65, then
the manure from a ton of bran is worth <i>more</i> than $14.59. There
need be no doubt on this point.</p>

<p>Settle in your own mind what the manure from a ton of any one of the
foods mentioned is worth on your farm, and you can easily calculate what
the manure is worth from all the others. If you say that the manure from
a ton of wheat-straw is worth $1.34, then the manure from a ton of
Indian corn is worth $3.33, and the manure from a ton of bran is worth
$7.30, and the manure from a ton of clover-hay is worth $4.82.</p>

<p>In this section, however, few good farmers are willing to sell straw,
though they can get from $8.00 to $10.00 per ton for it. They think it
must be consumed on the farm, or used for bedding, or their land will
run down. I&nbsp;do not say they are wrong, but I do say, that if a ton
of straw is worth $2.68 for manure alone, then a ton of clover-hay is
worth $9.64 for manure alone. This may be accepted as a general truth,
and one which a farmer can act upon. And so, too, in regard to the value
of corn-meal, bran, and all the other articles given in the table.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>There is another point of great importance which should be mentioned
in this connection. The nitrogen in the better class of foods is worth
more for manure than the nitrogen in straw, corn-stalks, and other
coarse fodder. Nearly all the nitrogen in grain, and other rich foods,
is digested by the animals, and is voided in solution in the urine. In
other words, the nitrogen in the manure is in an active and available
condition. On the other hand, only about half the nitrogen in the coarse
fodders and straw is digestible. The other half passes off in a crude
and comparatively unavailable condition, in the solid excrement. In
estimating the value of the manure from a ton of food, these facts
should be remembered.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50" id = "page50"> </a>
I have said that if the manure from a ton of straw is worth $2.68, the
manure from a ton of corn is worth $6.65; but I will not reverse the
proposition, and say that if the manure from a ton of corn is worth
$6.65, the manure from a ton of straw is worth $2.68. The manure from
the grain is nearly all in an available condition, while that from the
straw is not. A&nbsp;pound of nitrogen in rich manure is worth more than
a pound of nitrogen in poor manure. This is another reason why we should
try to make rich manure.</p>

CHAPTER XIII.</a></h4>

<h5>HORSE MANURE AND FARM-YARD MANURE.</h5>

<p>The manure from horses is generally considered richer and better than
that from cows. This is not always the case, though it is probably so as
a rule. There are three principal reasons for this. 1st. The horse is
usually fed more grain and hay than the cow. In other words, the food of
the horse is usually richer in the valuable elements of plant-food than
the ordinary food of the cow. 2d. The milk of the cow abstracts
considerable nitrogen, phosphoric acid, etc., from the food, and to this
extent there is less of these valuable substances in the excrements. 3d.
The excrements of the cow contain much more water than those of the
horse. And consequently a ton of cow-dung, other things being equal,
would not contain as much actual manure as a ton of horse-dung.</p>

<p>Boussingault, who is eminently trustworthy, gives us the following
interesting facts:</p>

<p>A horse consumed in 24 hours, 20 lbs. of hay, 6 lbs. of oats, and 43
lbs. of water, and voided during the same period, 3 lbs. 7 ozs. of
urine, and 38 lbs. 2 ozs. of solid excrements.</p>

<p>The solid excrements contained 23½ lbs. of water, and the urine 2
lbs. 6 ozs. of water.</p>

<p>According to this, a horse, eating 20 lbs. of hay, and 6 lbs. of
oats, per day, voids in a year nearly seven tons of solid excrements,
and 1,255 lbs. of urine.</p>

<p>It would seem that there must have been some mistake in collecting
the urine, or what was probably the case, that some of it must have been
absorbed by the dung; for 3½ pints of urine per day is certainly much
less than is usually voided by a horse.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
Stockard gives the amount of urine voided by a horse in a year at 3,000
lbs.; a&nbsp;cow, 8,000 lbs.; sheep, 380 lbs.; pig, 1,200 lbs.</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker, at the Royal Agricultural College, at Cirencester,
England, made some valuable investigations in regard to the composition
of farm-yard manure, and the changes which take place during
fermentation.</p>

<p>The manure was composed of horse, cow, and pig-dung, mixed with the
straw used for bedding in the stalls, pig-pens, sheds, etc.</p>

<p>On the 3d of November, 1854, a sample of what Dr. Vœlcker calls
“Fresh Long Dung,” was taken from the “manure-pit” for analysis. It had
lain in the pit or heap about 14 days.</p>

<p>The following is the result of the analysis:</p>

<p>Nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, are the most valuable
ingredients in manure. It will be seen that a ton of fresh barn-yard
manure, of probably good average quality, contains:</p>

I do not say that these are the only ingredients of any value in a ton
of manure. Nearly all the other ingredients are indispensable to the
growth of plants, and if we should use manures containing nothing but
nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, the time would come when the
crops would fail, from lack of a sufficient quantity of, perhaps,
magnesia, or lime, sulphuric acid, or soluble silica, or iron. But it is
not necessary to make provision for such a contingency. <ins class =
"correction" title = "word illegible">It</ins> would be a very
exceptional case. Farmers who depend mainly on barn-yard manure, or on
plowing under green crops for keeping up the fertility of the land, may
safely calculate that the value of the manure is in proportion to the
amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, it contains.</p>

<p>We draw out a ton of fresh manure and spread it on the land,
therefore, in order to furnish the growing crops with 12¾ lbs. of
nitrogen, 6½ lbs. of phosphoric acid, and 13½ lbs. of potash. Less than
33 lbs. in all!</p>

<p>We cannot dispense with farm-yard manure. We can seldom buy nitrogen,
phosphoric acid, and potash, as cheaply as we can get them in home-made
manures. But we should clearly understand the fact that we draw out
2,000 lbs. of matter in order to get 33 lbs. of these fertilizing
ingredients. We should <i>try to make richer manure</i>. A&nbsp;ton of
manure containing 60 lbs. of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash,
costs no more to draw out and spread, than a ton containing only 30
lbs., and it would be worth nearly or quite double the money.</p>

<p>How to make richer manure we will not discuss at this time. It is a
question of food. But it is worth while to enquire if we can not take
such manure as we have, and reduce its weight and bulk without losing
any of its nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash.</p>

<p>“It will be remarked,” says Dr. Vœlcker, “that in the first
experimental period, the fermentation of the dung, as might have been
expected, proceeded most rapidly, but that, notwithstanding, very little
nitrogen was dissipated in the form of volatile ammonia; and that on the
whole, the loss which the manure sustained was inconsiderable when
compared with the enormous waste to which it was subject in the
subsequent warmer and more rainy seasons of the year. Thus we find at
the end of April very nearly the same amount of nitrogen which is
contained in the fresh; whereas, at the end of August, 27.9 per cent of
the total nitrogen, or nearly one-third of the nitrogen in the manure,
has been wasted in one way or the other.</p>

<p>“It is worthy of observation,” continues Dr. Vœlcker, “that, during a
well-regulated fermentation of dung, the loss in intrinsically valuable
constituents is inconsiderable, and that in such a preparatory process
the <i>efficacy of the manure becomes greatly enhanced</i>. For certain
purposes fresh dung can never take the
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
place of well-rotted dung.<span class = "pad1"> **</span> The farmer
will, therefore, always be compelled to submit a portion of home-made
dung to fermentation, and will find satisfaction in knowing that this
process, when well regulated, is not attended with any serious
depreciation of the value of the manure. In the foregoing analyses he
will find the direct proof that as long as heavy showers of rain are
excluded from manure-heaps, or the manure is kept in water-proof pits,
the most valuable fertilizing matters are preserved.”</p>

<p>This experiment of Dr. Vœlcker proves conclusively that manure can be
kept in a rapid state of fermentation for six months during winter, with
little loss of nitrogen or other fertilizing matter.</p>

<p>During fermentation a portion of the insoluble matter of the dung
becomes soluble, and if the manure is then kept in a heap exposed to
rain, there is a great loss of fertilizing matter. This is precisely
what we should expect. We ferment manure to make it more readily
available as plant-food, and when we have attained our object, the
manure should be applied to the land. We keep winter apples in the
cellar until they get ripe. As soon as they are ripe, they should be
eaten, or they will rapidly decay. This is well understood. And it
should be equally well known that manure, after it has been fermenting
in a heap for six months, cannot safely be kept for another six months
exposed to the weather.</p>

<p>“A comparison of these different analyses,” says Dr. Vœlcker, “points
out clearly the changes which fresh farm-yard manure undergoes on
keeping in a heap, exposed to the influence of the weather during a
period of twelve months and twelve days.</p>

<p>“1. It will be perceived that the proportion of organic matter
steadily diminishes from month to month, until the original percentage
of organic matter in the dry manure, amounting to 83.48 per cent,
becomes reduced to 53 per cent.</p>

<p>“2. On the other hand, the total percentage of mineral matter rises
as steadily as that of the organic matter falls.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page56" id = "page56"> </a>
“3. It will be seen that the loss in organic matter affects the
percentage of insoluble organic matters more than the percentage of
soluble organic substances.</p>

<p>“4. The percentage of soluble organic matters, indeed, increased
considerably during the first experimental period; it rose, namely, from
7.33 per cent to 12.79 per cent. Examined again on the 30th of April,
very nearly the same percentage of soluble organic matter, as on
February the 14th, was found. The August analysis shows but a slight
decrease in the percentage of soluble organic matters, while there is a
decrease of 2 per cent of soluble organic matters when the November
analysis is compared with the February analysis.</p>

<p>“5. The soluble mineral matters in this manure rise or fall in the
different experimental periods in the same order as the soluble organic
matters. Thus, in February, 9.84 per cent of soluble mineral matters
were found, whilst the manure contained only 4.55 per cent, when put up
into a heap in November, 1854. Gradually, however, the proportion of
soluble mineral matters again diminished, and became reduced to 7.27 per
cent, on the examination of the manure in November, 1855.</p>

<p>“6. A similar regularity will be observed in the percentage of
nitrogen contained in the soluble organic matters.</p>

<p>“<ins class = "correction" title = "’7.’ missing in text">7.</ins> In
the insoluble organic matters, the percentage of nitrogen regularly
increased from November, 1854, up to the 23d of August, notwithstanding
the rapid diminution of the percentage of insoluble organic matter. For
the last experimental period, the percentage of nitrogen in the
insoluble matter is nearly the same as on August 23d.</p>

<p>“8. With respect to the total percentage of nitrogen in the fresh
manure, examined at different periods of the year, it will be seen that
the February manure contains about one-half per cent more of nitrogen
than the manure in a perfectly fresh state. On the 30th of April, the
percentage of nitrogen again slightly increased; on August 23d, it
remained stationary, and had sunk but very little when last examined on
the 15th of November, 1855.</p>

<p>“This series of analyses thus shows that fresh farm-yard manure
rapidly becomes more soluble in water, but that this desirable change is
realized at the expense of a large proportion of organic matters. It
likewise proves, in an unmistakable manner, that there is no advantage
in keeping farm-yard manure for too long a period; for, after February,
neither the percentage of soluble organic, nor that of soluble mineral
matter, has become greater,
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page57" id = "page57"> </a>
and the percentage of nitrogen in the manure of April and August is only
a very little higher than in February.”</p>

<p>“Before you go any further,” said the Deacon, “answer me this
question: Suppose I take five tons of farm-yard manure, and put it in a
heap on the 3d of November, tell me, 1st, what that heap will contain
when first made; 2d, what the heap will contain April 30th; and, 3d,
what the heap will contain August 23d.”</p>

<p>The Deacon put on his spectacles and studied the above table
carefully for some time. “That tells the whole story,” said he, “you put
five tons of fresh manure in a heap, it ferments and gets warm, and
nearly one ton of water is driven off by the heat.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Doctor, “you see that over half a ton (1,146 lbs.) of
dry organic matter has been slowly burnt up in the heap; giving out as
much heat as half a ton of coal burnt in a stove. But this is not all.
The manure is cooked, and steamed, and softened by the process. The
organic matter burnt up is of no value. There is little or no loss of
nitrogen. The heap contained 64.3 lbs. of nitrogen when put up, and 63.9
lbs. after fermenting six months. And it is evident that the manure is
in a much more active and available condition than if it had been
applied to the land in the fresh state. There was 14.9 lbs. of nitrogen
in a soluble condition in the fresh manure, and 21.4 lbs. in the
fermented manure. And what is equally important, you will notice that
there is 154 lbs. of soluble ash in the heap of fresh manure, and 204
lbs. in the heap of fermented manure. In other words, 50 lbs. of the
insoluble mineral matter had, by the fermentation of the manure, been
rendered soluble, and consequently immediately available as plant-food.
This is a very important fact.”</p>

<p>The Doctor is right. There is clearly a great advantage in fermenting
manure, provided it is done in such a manner as to prevent
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58" id = "page58"> </a>
loss. We have not only less manure to draw out and spread, but the
plant-food which it contains, is more soluble and active.</p>

<p>The table we have given shows that there is little or no loss of
valuable constituents, even when manure is fermented in the open air and
exposed to ordinary rain and snows during an English winter. But it also
shows that when the manure has been fermented for six months, and is
then turned and left exposed to the rain of spring and summer, the loss
is very considerable.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The five tons (10,000 lbs.,) of fresh manure placed in a heap on the
3d of November, are reduced to 7,138 lbs. by the 30th of April. Of this
4,707 lbs. is water. By the 23d of August, the heap is reduced to 7,025
lbs., of which 5,304 lbs. is water. There is nearly 600 lbs. more water
in the heap in August than in April.</p>

<p>Of total nitrogen in the heap, there is 64.3 lbs. in the fresh
manure, 63.9 lbs. in April, and only 46.3 lbs. in August. This is a
great loss, and there is no compensating gain.</p>

<p>We have seen that, when five tons of manure is fermented for six
months, in winter, the nitrogen in the soluble organic matter is
increased from 14.9 lbs. to 21.4 lbs. This is a decided advantage. But
when the manure is kept for another six months, this soluble nitrogen is
decreased from 21.4 lbs. to 13.2 lbs. We lose over 8 lbs. of the most
active and available nitrogen.</p>

<p>And the same remarks will apply to the valuable soluble mineral
matter. In the five tons of fresh manure there is 154 lbs. of soluble
mineral matter. By fermenting the heap six months, we get 204 lbs., but
by keeping the manure six months longer, the soluble mineral matter is
reduced to 138 lbs. We lose 66 lbs. of valuable soluble mineral
matter.</p>

<p>By fermenting manure for six months in winter, we greatly improve its
condition; by keeping it six months longer, we lose largely of the very
best and most active parts of the manure.</p>

<h5>KEEPING MANURE UNDER COVER.</h5>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker, at the same time he made the experiments alluded to in
the preceding chapter, placed another heap of manure <i>under cover</i>,
in a shed. It was the same kind of manure, and was treated precisely as
the other&mdash;the only difference being that one heap was exposed to
the rain, and the other not. The following table gives the results of
the weighings of the heap at different times, and also the percentage of
loss:</p>

<p>It will be seen that 100 tons of manure, kept in a heap under cover
for six months, would be reduced to <ins class = "correction" title =
"format as in original: ‘49 6/10’">49.6-10</ins> tons. Whereas, when the
same manure was fermented for the same length of time in the open air,
the 100 tons was reduced to only <ins class = "correction" title =
"format as in original: ‘71 4/10’">71.4-10</ins> tons. The difference is
due principally to the fact that the heap exposed contained more water,
derived from rain and snow, than the heap kept under cover. This, of
course, is what we should expect. Let us look at the results of Dr.
Vœlcker’s analyses:</p>

<p>The above analyses are of value to those who buy fresh and fermented
manure. They can form some idea of what they are getting. If they buy a
ton of fresh manure in November, they get 12¾ lbs. of nitrogen, and 30¾
lbs. of soluble mineral matter. If
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61" id = "page61"> </a>
they buy a ton of the same manure that has been kept under cover until
February, they get, nitrogen, 15 lbs.; soluble minerals, 42½ lbs. In
April, they get, nitrogen, 23¾ lbs.; soluble minerals, 67½ lbs. In
August, they get, nitrogen, 25½ lbs.; soluble minerals, 61 lbs. In
November, when the manure is over one year old, they get, in a ton,
nitrogen, 30¼ lbs.; soluble minerals, 88½ lbs.</p>

<p>When manure has not been exposed, it is clear that a purchaser can
afford to pay considerably more for a ton of rotted manure than for a
ton of fresh manure. But waiving this point for the present, let us see
how the matter stands with the farmer who makes and uses the manure.
What does he gain by keeping and fermenting the manure under cover?</p>

<p>It will be seen that the heap of manure kept under cover contained,
on the 30th of April, <i>less</i> soluble organic matter, <i>less</i>
soluble mineral matter, <i>less</i> soluble nitrogenous matter, and
<i>less</i> total nitrogen than the heap of manure exposed to the
weather. This is precisely what I should have expected. The heap of
manure in the shed probably fermented more rapidly than the heap out of
doors, and there was not water enough in the manure to retain the
carbonate of ammonia, or to favor the production of organic acids.
<i>The heap was too dry.</i> If it could have received enough of the
liquid from the stables to have kept it moderately moist, the result
would have been very different.</p>

<p>We will postpone further consideration of this point at present, and
look at the results of another of Dr. Vœlcker’s interesting
experiments.</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker wished to ascertain the effect of three common methods of
managing manure:</p>

<p>1st. Keeping it in a <i>heap</i> in the open air in the barn-yard, or
field.</p>

<p>2d. Keeping it in a <i>heap</i> under cover in a shed.</p>

<p>3d. Keeping it <i>spread out</i> over the barn-yard.</p>

<p>“You say these are common methods of managing manure,” remarked the
Deacon, “but I never knew any one in this country take the trouble to
spread manure over the yard.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” I replied, “but you have known a good many farmers who
adopt this very method of keeping their manure. They do not spread
it&mdash;but they let it lie spread out over the yards, just wherever it
happens to be.”</p>

<p>Let us see what the effect of this treatment is on the composition
and value of the manure.</p>

<p>We have examined the effect of keeping manure in a heap in
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page63" id = "page63"> </a>
the open air, and also of keeping it in a heap under cover. Now let us
see how these methods compare with the practice of leaving it exposed to
the rains, spread out in the yard.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of November, 1854, Dr. Vœlcker weighed out 1,652 lbs. of
manure similar to that used in the preceding experiments, and spread it
out in the yard. It was weighed April 30, and again August 23, and
November 15.</p>

different periods, also the actual amount of the water, organic matter,
ash, nitrogen, etc.:</p>

<p>“One moment,” said the Deacon. “These tables are a little confusing.
The table you have just given shows the actual weight of the manure in
the heap, and what it contained at different periods.” &mdash;“Yes,”
said I, “and the table following shows what 100 lbs. of this manure,
spread out in the yard, contained at the different dates mentioned. It
shows how greatly manure deteriorates by being exposed to rain, spread
out on the surface of the yard. The table merits careful study.”</p>

<p>It is not necessary to make many remarks on this table. The facts
speak for themselves. It will be seen that there is considerable loss
even by letting the manure lie spread out until spring; but, serious as
this loss is, it is small compared to the loss sustained by allowing the
manure to lie exposed in the yard during the summer.</p>

<p>In the five tons of fresh manure, we have, November 3, 64.3 lbs. of
nitrogen; April 30, we have 46 lbs.; August 23, only 25 lbs. This is a
great loss of the most valuable constituent of the manure. Of soluble
mineral matter, the next most valuable ingredient, we have in the five
tons of fresh manure, November 3, 154 lbs.; April 30, 87 lbs.; and
August 23, only 39 lbs. Of soluble nitrogen, the most active and
valuable part of the manure, we have, November 3, nearly 15 lbs.; April
30, not quite 7 lbs.; August 23, 3½ lbs.; and November 15, not quite 1¾
lbs.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Dr. Vœlcker made still another experiment. He took 1,613 lbs. of
<i>well-rotted</i> dung (mixed manure from horses, cows, and pigs,) and
kept it in a heap, exposed to the weather, from December 5 to April 30,
August 23, and November 15, weighing it and analyzing it at these
different dates. I&nbsp;think it is not necessary to give the results in
detail. From the 5th of December to the 30th of April, there was <i>no
loss</i> of nitrogen in the heap, and comparatively little loss of
soluble mineral matters; but from April 30 to August 23, there was
considerable loss in both these valuable ingredients, which were washed
out of the heap by rain.</p>

Dr. <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Voelcker’">Vœlcker</ins> draws the following conclusions
from his experiments:</p>

<p>“Having described at length my experiments with farm-yard manure,” he
says, “it may not be amiss to state briefly the more prominent and
practically interesting points which have been developed in the course
of this investigation. I&nbsp;would, therefore, observe:</p>

<p>“1. Perfectly fresh farm yard manure contains but a small proportion
of free ammonia.</p>

<p>“2. The nitrogen in fresh dung exists principally in the state of
insoluble nitrogenized matters.</p>

<p>“3. The soluble organic and mineral constituents of dung are much
more valuable fertilizers than the insoluble. Particular care,
therefore, should be bestowed upon the preservation of the liquid
excrements of animals, and for the same reason the manure should be kept
in perfectly water-proof pits of sufficient capacity to render the
setting up of dung-heaps in the corner of fields, as much as it is
possible, unnecessary.</p>

<p>“4. Farm-yard manure, even in quite a fresh state, contains phosphate
of lime, which is much more soluble than has hitherto been
suspected.</p>

<p>“5. The urine of the horse, cow, and pig, does not contain any
appreciable quantity of phosphate of lime, whilst the drainings of
dung-heaps contain considerable quantities of this valuable fertilizer.
The drainings of dung-heaps, partly for this reason, are more valuable
than the urine of our domestic animals, and, therefore, ought to be
prevented by all available means from running to waste.</p>

<p>“6. The most effectual means of preventing loss in fertilizing
matters is to cart the manure directly on the field whenever
circumstances allow this to be done.</p>

<p>“7. On all soils with a moderate proportion of clay, no fear need to
be entertained of valuable fertilizing substances becoming wasted if the
manure cannot be plowed in at once. Fresh, and even well-rotten, dung
contains very little free ammonia; and since active fermentation, and
with it the further evolution of free ammonia, is stopped by spreading
out the manure on the field, valuable volatile manuring matters can not
escape into the air by adopting this plan.</p>

<p>“As all soils with a moderate proportion of clay possess in a
remarkable degree the power of absorbing and retaining manuring matters,
none of the saline and soluble organic constituents are wasted even by a
heavy fall of rain. It may, indeed, be questioned
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67" id = "page67"> </a>
whether it is more advisable to plow in the manure at once, or to let it
lie for some time on the surface, and to give the rain full opportunity
to wash it into the soil.</p>

<p>“It appears to me a matter of the greatest importance to regulate the
application of manure to our fields, so that its constituents may become
properly diluted and uniformly distributed amongst a large mass of soil.
By plowing in the manure at once, it appears to me, this desirable end
can not be reached so perfectly as by allowing the rain to wash in
gradually the manure evenly spread on the surface of the field.</p>

<p>“By adopting such a course, in case practical experience should
confirm my theoretical reasoning, the objection could no longer be
maintained that the land is not ready for carting manure upon it.
I&nbsp;am inclined to recommend, as a general rule: Cart the manure on
the field, spread it at once, and wait for a favorable opportunity to
plow it in. In the case of clay soils, I&nbsp;have no hesitation to say
the manure may be spread even six months before it is plowed in, without
losing any appreciable quantity in manuring matter.</p>

<p>“I am perfectly aware, that on stiff clay land, farm-yard manure,
more especially long dung, when plowed in before the frost sets in,
exercises a most beneficial action by keeping the soil loose, and
admitting the free access of frost, which pulverizes the land, and
would, therefore, by no means recommend to leave the manure spread on
the surface without plowing it in. All I wish to enforce is, that when
no other choice is left but either to set up the manure in a heap in a
corner of the field, or to spread it on the field, without plowing it in
directly, to adopt the latter plan. In the case of very light sandy
soils, it may perhaps not be advisable to spread out the manure a long
time before it is plowed in, since such soils do not possess the power
of retaining manuring matters in any marked degree. On light sandy
soils, I&nbsp;would suggest to manure with well-fermented dung, shortly
before the crop intended to be grown is sown.</p>

<p>“8. Well-rotten dung contains, likewise, little free ammonia, but a
very much larger proportion of soluble organic and saline mineral
matters than fresh manure.</p>

<p>“9. Rotten dung is richer in nitrogen than fresh.</p>

<p>“10. Weight for weight, rotten dung is more valuable than fresh.</p>

<p>“11. In the fermentation of dung, a&nbsp;very considerable proportion
of the organic matters in fresh manure is dissipated into the air in the
form of carbonic acid and other gases.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<a name = "page68" id = "page68"> </a>
“12. Properly regulated, however, the fermentation of dung is not
attended with any great loss of nitrogen, nor of saline mineral
matters.</p>

<p>“13. During the fermentation of dung, ulmic, humic, and other organic
acids are formed, as well as gypsum, which fix the ammonia generated in
the decomposition of the nitrogenized constituents of dung.</p>

<p>“14. During the fermentation of dung, the phosphate of lime which it
contains is rendered more soluble than in fresh manure.</p>

<p>“15. In the interior and heated portions of manure-heaps, ammonia is
given off; but, on passing into the external and cold layers of
dung-heaps, the free ammonia is retained in the heap.</p>

<p>“16. Ammonia is not given off from the surface of well-compressed
dung-heaps, but on turning manure-heaps, it is wasted in appreciable
quantities. Dung-heaps, for this reason, should not be turned more
frequently than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>“17. No advantage appears to result from carrying on the fermentation
of dung too far, but every disadvantage.</p>

<p>“18. Farm-yard manure becomes deteriorated in value, when kept in
heaps exposed to the weather, the more the longer it is kept.</p>

<p>“19. The loss in manuring matters, which is incurred in keeping
manure-heaps exposed to the weather, is not so much due to the
volatilization of ammonia as to the removal of ammoniacal salts, soluble
nitrogenized organic matters, and valuable mineral matters, by the rain
which falls in the period during which the manure is kept.</p>

<p>“20. If rain is excluded from dung-heaps, or little rain falls at a
time, the loss in ammonia is trifling, and no saline matters, of course,
are removed; but, if much rain falls, especially if it descends in heavy
showers upon the dung-heap, a&nbsp;serious loss in ammonia, soluble
organic matter, phosphate of lime, and salts of potash is incurred, and
the manure becomes rapidly deteriorated in value, whilst at the same
time it is diminished in weight.</p>

<p>“21. Well-rotten dung is more readily affected by the deteriorating
influence of rain than fresh manure.</p>

<p>“22. Practically speaking, all the essentially valuable manuring
constituents are preserved by keeping farm-yard manure under cover.</p>

<p>“23. If the animals have been supplied with plenty of litter, fresh
dung contains an insufficient quantity of water to induce an active
fermentation. In this case, fresh dung can not be properly
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page69" id = "page69"> </a>
fermented under cover, except water or liquid manure is pumped over the
heap from time to time.</p>

<p>“Where much straw is used in the manufacture of dung, and no
provision is made to supply the manure in the pit at any time with the
requisite amount of moisture, it may not be advisable to put up a roof
over the dung-pit. On the other hand, on farms where there is a
deficiency of straw, so that the moisture of the excrements of our
domestic animals is barely absorbed by the litter, the advantage of
erecting a roof over the dung-pit will be found very great.</p>

<p>“24. The worst method of making manure is to produce it by animals
kept in open yards, since a large proportion of valuable fertilizing
matters is wasted in a short time; and after a lapse of twelve months,
at least two-thirds of the substance of the manure is wasted, and only
one-third, inferior in quality to an equal weight of fresh dung, is left
behind.</p>

<p>“25. The most rational plan of keeping manure in heaps appears to me
that adopted by Mr. Lawrence, of Cirencester, and described by him at
length in Morton’s ‘Cyclopædia of Agriculture,’ under the head of
‘Manure.’”</p>

<hr class = "tiny section">

CHAPTER XVI.</a></h4>

<h5>AN ENGLISH PLAN OF KEEPING MANURE.</h5>

<p>“I would like to know,” said the Deacon, “how Mr. Lawrence manages
his manure, especially as his method has received such high
commendation.”</p>

<p>Charley got the second volume of “Morton’s Cyclopædia of
Agriculture,” from the book shelves, and turned to the article on
“Manure.” He found that Mr. Lawrence adopted the “Box System” of feeding
cattle, and used cut or chaffed straw for bedding. And Mr. Lawrence
claims that by this plan “manure will have been made under the most
perfect conditions.” And “when the boxes are full at those periods of
the year at which manure is required for the succeeding crops, it will
be most advantageously disposed of by being transferred at once to the
land, and covered in.”</p>

<p>“Good<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">,”</ins>
said the Deacon, “I&nbsp;think he is right there.” Charley continued,
and read as follows:</p>

<p>“But there will be accumulations of manure requiring removal
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page70" id = "page70"> </a>
from the homestead at other seasons, at which it cannot be so applied,
and when it must be stored for future use. The following has been found
an effectual and economical mode of accomplishing this; more
particularly when cut litter is used, it saves the cost of repeated
turnings, and effectually prevents the decomposition and waste of the
most active and volatile principle.</p>

<p>“Some three or more spots are selected according to the size of the
farm, in convenient positions for access to the land under tillage, and
by the side of the farm roads. The sites fixed on are then excavated
about two feet under the surrounding surface. In the bottom is laid some
three or four inches of earth to absorb any moisture, on which the
manure is emptied from the carts. This is evenly spread, and well
trodden as the heap is forming. As soon as this is about a foot above
the ground level, to allow for sinking, the heap is gradually gathered
in, until it is completed in the form of an ordinary steep roof,
slightly rounded at the top by the final treading. In the course of
building this up, about a bushel of salt, to two cart-loads of dung is
sprinkled amongst it. The base laid out at any one time should not
exceed that required by the manure ready for the complete formation of
the heap as far as it goes; and within a day or two after such portion
is built up, and it has settled into shape, a&nbsp;thin coat of earth in
a moist state is plastered <i>entirely</i> over the surface. Under these
conditions decomposition does not take place, in consequence of the
exclusion of the air; or at any rate to so limited an extent, that the
ammonia is absorbed by the earth, for there is not a trace of it
perceptible about the heap; though, when put together without such
covering, this is perceptible enough to leeward at a hundred yards’
distance.</p>

<p>“When heaps thus formed are resorted to in the autumn, either for the
young seeds, or for plowing in on the stubbles after preparing for the
succeeding root crop, the manure will be found undiminished in quantity
and unimpaired in quality; in fact, simply consolidated. Decomposition
then proceeds within the soil, where all its results are appropriated,
and rendered available for the succeeding cereal as well as the root
crop.</p>

<p>“It would be inconvenient to plaster the heap, were the ridge, when
settled, above six or seven feet from the ground level; the base may be
formed about ten to twelve feet wide, and the ridge about nine feet from
the base, which settles down to about seven feet; this may be extended
to any length as further supplies of manure require removal. One man is
sufficient to form the heap, and it is expedient to employ the same man
for this service, who soon gets into the way of performing the work
neatly and quickly.
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
It has been asked where a farmer is to get the earth to cover his
heaps&mdash;it may be answered, keep your roads scraped when they get
muddy on the surface during rainy weather&mdash;in itself good
economy&mdash;and leave this in small heaps beyond the margin of your
roads. This, in the course of the year, will be found an ample provision
for the purpose, for it is unnecessary to lay on a coat more than one or
two inches in thickness, which should be done when in a moist state. At
any rate, there will always be found an accumulation on headlands that
may be drawn upon if need be.</p>

<p>“Farmers who have not been in the habit of bestowing care on the
manufacture and subsequent preservation of their manure, and watching
results, have no conception of the importance of this. A&nbsp;barrowful
of such manure as has been described, would produce a greater weight of
roots and corn, than that so graphically described by the most talented
and accomplished of our agricultural authors&mdash;as the contents of
‘neighbour Drychaff’s dung-cart, that creaking hearse, that is carrying
to the field the dead body whose spirit has departed.’</p>

<p>“There is a source of valuable and extremely useful manure on every
farm, of which very few farmers avail themselves&mdash;the gathering
together in one spot of all combustible waste and rubbish, the clippings
of hedges, scouring of ditches, grassy accumulation on the sides of
roads and fences, etc., combined with a good deal of earth. If these are
carted at leisure times into a large circle, or in two rows, to supply
the fire kindled in the center, in a spot which is frequented by the
laborers on the farm, with a three-pronged fork and a shovel attendant,
and each passer-by is encouraged to add to the pile whenever he sees the
smoke passing away so freely as to indicate rapid combustion,
a&nbsp;very large quantity of valuable ashes are collected between March
and October. In the latter month the fire should be allowed to go out;
the ashes are then thrown into a long ridge, as high as they will stand,
and thatched while dry. This will be found an invaluable store in April,
May, and June, capable of supplying from twenty to forty bushels of
ashes per acre, according to the care and industry of the collector, to
drill with the seeds of the root crop.”</p>

<p>The Deacon got sleepy before Charley finished reading. “We can not
afford to be at so much trouble in this country,” he said, and took up
his hat and left.</p>

<p>The Deacon is not altogether wrong. Our climate is very different
from that of England, and it is seldom that farmers need to draw out
manure, and pile it in the field, except in winter, and
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>
then it is not necessary, I&nbsp;think, either to dig a pit or to cover
the heap. Those who draw manure from the city in summer, may probably
adopt some of Mr. Lawrence’s suggestions with advantage.</p>

<p>The plan of collecting rubbish, brush, old wood, and sods, and
converting them into ashes or charcoal, is one which we could often
adopt with decided advantage. Our premises would be cleaner, and we
should have less fungus to speck and crack our apples and pears, and, in
addition, we should have a quantity of ashes or burnt earth, that is not
only a manure itself, but is specially useful to mix with moist
superphosphate and other artificial manures, to make them dry enough and
bulky enough to be easily and evenly distributed by the drill.
Artificial manures, so mixed with these ashes, or dry, charred earth,
are less likely to injure the seed than when sown with the seed in the
drill-rows, unmixed with some such material. Sifted coal ashes are also
very useful for this purpose.</p>

CHAPTER XVII.</a></h4>

<h5>SOLUBLE PHOSPHATES IN FARMYARD MANURE.</h5>

<p>There is one thing in these experiments of Dr. Vœlcker’s which
deserves special attention, and that is the comparatively large amount
of <i>soluble phosphate of lime</i> in the ash of farm-yard manure.
I&nbsp;do not think the fact is generally known. In estimating the value
of animal manures, as compared with artificial manures, it is usually
assumed that the phosphates in the former are insoluble, and, therefore,
of less value than the soluble phosphates in superphosphate of lime and
other artificial manures.</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker found in the ash of <i>fresh</i> farm-yard manure,
phosphoric acid equal to 12.23 per cent of phosphate of lime, and of
this 5.35 was <i>soluble</i> phosphate of lime.</p>

<p>In the ash of well-rotted manure, he found phosphoric acid equal to
12.11 per cent of phosphate of lime, and of this, 4.75 was soluble
phosphate of lime.</p>

<p>“That is, indeed, an important fact,” said the Doctor, “but I thought
Professor Vœlcker claimed that ‘during the fermentation of dung, the
phosphate of lime which it contains is rendered more soluble than in
fresh manure.’”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73" id = "page73"> </a>
“He did say so,” I replied, “and it may be true, but the above figures
do not seem to prove it. When he wrote the sentence you have quoted, he
probably had reference to the fact that he found more soluble phosphate
of lime in rotted manure than in fresh manure. Thus, he found in 5 tons
of fresh and 5 tons of rotted, manure, the following ingredients:</p>

<p>“It will be seen from the above figures that <i>rotted manure
contains more soluble phosphate of lime than fresh manure</i>.</p>

<p>“But it does not follow from this fact that any of the insoluble
phosphates in fresh manure have been rendered soluble during the
fermentation of the manure.</p>

<p>“There are more insoluble phosphates in the rotted manure than in the
fresh, but we do not conclude from this fact that any of the phosphates
have been rendered insoluble during the process of
fermentation&mdash;neither are we warranted in concluding that any of
them have been rendered soluble, simply because we find more soluble
phosphates in the rotted manure.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” said the Doctor, “but it has been shown that <i>in the
heap</i> of manure, during fermentation, there was an <i>actual
increase</i> of soluble mineral matter during the first six months, and,
to say the least, it is highly probable that some of this increase of
soluble mineral matter contained more or less soluble phosphates, and
perhaps Dr. Vœlcker had some facts to show that such was the case,
although he may not have published them. At any rate, he evidently
thinks that the phosphates in manure are rendered more soluble by
fermentation.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said I, “we can not do better than to let the matter rest
in that form. I&nbsp;am merely anxious not to draw definite conclusions
from the facts which the facts do not positively prove. I&nbsp;am
strongly in favor of fermenting manure, and should be glad to have it
shown that fermentation does actually convert insoluble phosphates into
a soluble form.”</p>

<p>There is one thing, however, that these experiments clearly prove,
and that is, that there is a far larger quantity of <i>soluble</i>
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page74" id = "page74"> </a>
phosphates in manure than is generally supposed. Of the total phosphoric
acid in the fresh manure, 43 per cent is in a soluble condition; and in
the rotted manure, 40 per cent is soluble.</p>

<p>This is an important fact, and one which is generally overlooked. It
enhances the value of farm-yard or stable manure, as compared with
artificial manures. But of this we may have more to say when we come to
that part of the subject. I&nbsp;want to make one remark. I&nbsp;think
there can be little doubt that the proportion of soluble phosphates is
greater in rich manure, made from grain-fed animals, than in poor manure
made principally from straw. In other words, of 100 lbs. of total
phosphoric acid, more of it would be in a soluble condition in the rich
than in the poor manure.</p>

<h5>HOW THE DEACON MAKES MANURE.</h5>

<p>“I think,” said the Deacon, “you are talking too much about the
science of manure making. Science is all well enough, but practice is
better.”</p>

<p>“That depends,” said I, “on the practice. Suppose you tell us how you
manage your manure.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Deacon, “I do not know much about plant-food, and
nitrogen, and phosphoric acid, but I think manure is a good thing, and
the more you have of it the better. I&nbsp;do not believe in your
practice of spreading manure on the land and letting it lie exposed to
the sun and winds. I&nbsp;want to draw it out in the spring and plow it
under for corn. I&nbsp;think this long, coarse manure loosens the soil
and makes it light, and warm, and porous. And then my plan saves labor.
More than half of my manure is handled but once. It is made in the yard
and sheds, and lies there until it is drawn to the field in the spring.
The manure from the cow and horse stables, and from the pig-pens, is
thrown into the yard, and nothing is done to it except to level it down
occasionally. In proportion to the stock kept, I&nbsp;think I make twice
as much manure as you do.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “twice as much <i>in bulk</i>, but one load of my
manure is worth four loads of your long, coarse manure, composed

principally of corn-stalks, straw, and water. I&nbsp;think you are wise
in not spending much time in piling and working over such manure.”</p>

<p>The Deacon and I have a standing quarrel about manure. We differ on
all points. He is a good man, but not what we call a good farmer. He
cleared up his farm from the original forest, and he has always been
content to receive what his land would give him. If he gets good crops,
well, if not, his expenses are moderate, and he manages to make both
ends meet. I&nbsp;tell him he could double his crops, and quadruple his
profits, by better farming&mdash;but though he cannot disprove the
facts, he is unwilling to make any change in his system of farming. And
so he continues to make just as much manure as the crops he is obliged
to feed out leave in his yards, and no more. He does not, in fact,
<i>make</i> any manure. He takes what comes, and gets it on to his land
with as little labor as possible.</p>

<p>It is no use arguing with such a man. And it certainly will not do to
contend that his method of <i>managing</i> manure is all wrong. His
error is in making such poor manure. But with such poor stuff as he has
in his yard, I&nbsp;believe he is right to get rid of it with the least
expense possible.</p>

<p>I presume, too, that the Deacon is not altogether wrong in regard to
the good mechanical effects of manure on undrained and indifferently
cultivated land. I&nbsp;have no doubt that he bases his opinion on
experience. The good effects of such manure as he makes must be largely
due to its mechanical action&mdash;it can do little towards supplying
the more important and valuable elements of plant-food.</p>

<p>I commend the Deacon’s system of managing manure to all such as make
a similar article. But I think there is a more excellent way. Feed the
stock better, make richer manure, and then it will pay to bestow a
little labor in taking care of it.</p>

CHAPTER XIX.</a></h4>

<h5>HOW JOHN JOHNSTON MANAGES HIS MANURE.</h5>

<p>One of the oldest and most successful farmers, in the State of New
York, is John Johnston, of Geneva. He has a farm on the borders of
Seneca Lake. It is high, rolling land, but needed <ins class =
"correction" title =
"text reads ‘under draining’ at line break">underdraining</ins>. This has been thoroughly done&mdash;and done
with great profit and advantage. The soil is a heavy clay loam. Mr.
Johnston has been in the habit of summer-fallowing largely for wheat,
generally plowing three, and sometimes four times. He has been a very
successful wheat-grower, almost invariably obtaining large crops of
wheat, both of grain and straw. The straw he feeds to sheep in winter,
putting more straw in the racks than the sheep can eat up clean, and
using what they leave for bedding. The sheep run in yards enclosed with
tight board fences, and have sheds under the barn to lie in at
pleasure.</p>

<p>Although the soil is rather heavy for Indian corn, Mr. Johnston
succeeds in growing large crops of this great American cereal. Corn and
stalks are both fed out on the farm. Mr.&nbsp;J. has not yet practised
cutting up his straw and stalks into chaff.</p>

<p>The land is admirably adapted to the growth of red clover, and great
crops of clover and timothy-hay are raised, and fed out on the farm.
Gypsum, or plaster, is sown quite freely on the clover in the spring.
Comparatively few roots are raised&mdash;not to exceed an acre&mdash;and
these only quite recently. The main crops are winter wheat, spring
barley, Indian corn, clover, and timothy-hay, and clover-seed.</p>

<p>The materials for making manure, then, are wheat and barley straw,
Indian corn, corn-stalks, clover, and timothy-hay. These are all raised
on the farm. But Mr. Johnston has for many years purchased linseed-oil
cake, to feed to his sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>This last fact must not be overlooked. Mr.&nbsp;J. commenced to feed
oil-cake when its value was little known here, and when he bought it
for, I&nbsp;think, seven or eight dollars a ton. He continued to use it
even when he had to pay fifty dollars per ton. Mr.&nbsp;J. has great
faith in manure&mdash;and it is a faith resting on good evidence and
long experience. If he had not fed out so much oil-cake and clover-hay,
he would not have found his manure so valuable.</p>

<p>“How much oil-cake does he use?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>“He gives his sheep, on the average, about 1&nbsp;lb. each per
day.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
If he feeds out a ton of clover-hay, two tons of straw, (for feed and
bedding,) and one ton of oil-cake, the manure obtained from this
quantity of food and litter, would be worth, according to Mr. Lawes’
table, given on page 45, $34.72.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if he fed out one ton of corn, one ton of
clover-hay, and two tons of straw, for feed and bedding, the manure
would be worth $21.65.</p>

<p>If he fed one ton of corn, and three tons of straw, the manure would
be worth only $14.69.</p>

<p>He would get <i>as much manure</i> from the three tons of straw and
one ton of corn, as from the two tons of straw, one ton of clover-hay,
and one ton of oil-cake, while, as before said, the manure in the one
case would be worth $14.69, and in the other $34.72.</p>

<p>In other words, a load of the good manure would be worth, when spread
out on the land in the field or garden, more than two loads of the straw
and corn manure.</p>

<p>To get the same amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, you
have to spend more than twice the labor in cleaning out the stables or
yards, more than twice the labor of throwing or wheeling it to the
manure pile, more than twice the labor of turning the manure in the
pile, more than twice the labor of loading it on the carts or wagons,
more than twice the labor of drawing it to the field, more than twice
the labor of unloading it into heaps, and more than twice the labor of
spreading it in the one case than in the other, and, after all, twenty
tons of this poor manure would not produce as good an effect the first
season as ten tons of the richer manure.</p>

<p>“Why so<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘”?’">?”</ins>
asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>“Simply because the poor manure is not so active as the richer
manure. It will not decompose so readily. Its nitrogen, phosphoric acid,
and potash, are not so available. The twenty tons, <i>may</i>, in the
long run, do as much good as the ten tons, but I very much doubt it. At
any rate, I&nbsp;would greatly prefer the ten tons of the good manure to
twenty tons of the poor&mdash;even when spread out on the land, ready to
plow under. What the difference would be in the value of the manure
<i>in the yard</i>, you can figure for yourself. It would depend on the
cost of handling, drawing, and spreading the extra ten tons.”</p>

<p>The Deacon estimates the cost of loading, drawing, unloading, and
spreading, at fifty cents a ton. This is probably not far out of the
way, though much depends on the distance the manure has to be drawn, and
also on the condition of the manure, etc.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page78" id = "page78"> </a>
The four tons of feed and bedding will make, at a rough estimate about
ten tons of manure.</p>

<p>This ten tons of straw and corn manure, according to Mr. Lawes’
estimate, is worth, <i>in the field</i>, $14.69. And if it costs fifty
cents a load to get it on the land, its value, <i>in the yard</i>, would
be $9.69&mdash;or nearly ninety-seven cents a ton.</p>

<p>The ten tons of good manure, according to the same estimate, is
worth, <i>in the field</i>, $34.72, and, consequently, would be worth,
<i>in the yard</i>, $29.72. In other words, a&nbsp;ton of poor manure is
worth, in the yard, ninety-seven cents a ton, and the good manure
$2.97.</p>

<p>And so in describing John Johnston’s method of managing manure, this
fact must be borne in mind. It might not pay the Deacon to spend much
labor on manure worth only ninety-seven cents a ton, while it might pay
John Johnston to bestow some considerable time and labor on manure worth
$2.97 per ton.</p>

<p>“But is it really worth this sum?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>“In reply to that,” said I, “all I claim is that the figures are
comparative. If your manure, made as above described, is worth
ninety-seven cents a ton in the yard, <i>then</i> John Johnston’s
manure, made as stated, is <i>certainly</i> worth, at least, $2.97 per
ton in the yard.”</p>

<p>Of this there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>“If you think,” I continued, “your manure, so made, is worth only
half as much as Mr. Lawes’ estimate; in other words, if your ten tons of
manure, instead of being worth $14.69 in the field, is worth only $7.35;
then John Johnston’s ten tons of manure, instead of being worth $34.72
in the field, is worth only $17.36.”</p>

<p>“That looks a little more reasonable,” said the Deacon, “John
Johnston’s manure, instead of being worth $2.97 per ton in the yard, is
worth only $1.48 per ton, and mine, instead of being worth ninety-seven
cents a ton, is worth forty-eight and a half cents a ton.”</p>

<p>The Deacon sat for a few minutes looking at these figures. “They do
not seem so extravagantly high as I thought them at first,” he said,
“and if you will reduce the figures in Mr. Lawes’ table one-half all
through, it will be much nearer the truth. I&nbsp;think my manure is
worth forty-eight and a half cents a ton in the yard, and if your
figures are correct, I&nbsp;suppose I must admit that John Johnston’s
manure is worth $1.48 per ton in the yard.”</p>

<p>I was very glad to get such an admission from the Deacon. He did not
see that he had made a mistake in the figures, and so I got him to go
over the calculation again.</p>

<p>“This will make about ten tons of manure. In this case, as in the

$7.35 as the value of this ten tons of manure in the field, or 73½ cents
a ton. It costs, we have estimated, 50 cents a ton to handle the manure,
and, therefore, it is worth <i>in the yard</i>, 23½ cents a ton.”</p>

<p>“John Johnston’s manure is worth in the yard, $1.23 per ton. The
Deacon’s manure is worth in the yard, 23½ cents per ton.”</p>

<p>“There is some mistake,” exclaimed the Deacon, “you said, at first,
that one load of John Johnston’s manure was worth as much as two of my
loads. Now you make one load of his manure worth more than five loads of
my manure. This is absurd.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Deacon,” said I, “you made the figures yourself. You
thought Mr. Lawes’ estimate too high. You reduced it one-half. The
figures are correct, and you must accept the conclusion. If John
Johnston’s manure is only worth $1.23 per ton in the yard, yours, made
from 1 ton of corn and 3 tons of straw, is only worth 23½ cents per

give you about 10 tons of manure. And this 10 tons cost you 50 cents a
ton to load, draw out, and spread. Now figure:</p>

<p>“That is <i>too</i> absurd,” said the Deacon.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I replied, “for once I am glad to agree with you. But if
this is absurd, then it follows that Mr. Lawes’ estimate of the value of
certain foods for manure is not so extravagant as you
supposed&mdash;which is precisely what I wished to prove.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“You have not told us how Mr. Johnston manages his manure,” said the
Deacon.</p>

<p>“There is nothing very remarkable about it,” I replied. “There are
many farmers in this neighborhood who adopt the same method.
I&nbsp;think, however, John Johnston was the first to recommend it, and
subjected himself to some criticism from some of the so-called
scientific writers at the time.</p>

<p>“His general plan is to leave the manure in the yards, basements, and
sheds, under the sheep, until spring. He usually sells his fat sheep in
March. As soon as the sheep are removed, the manure is either thrown up
into loose heaps in the yard, or drawn directly to the field, where it
is to be used, and made into a heap there. The manure is not spread on
the land until the autumn. It remains in the heaps or piles all summer,
being usually turned once, and sometimes twice. The manure becomes
thoroughly rotted.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Mr. Johnston, like the Deacon, applies his manure to the corn crop.
But the Deacon draws out his fresh green manure in the spring, on
sod-land, and plows it under. Mr. Johnston, on the other hand, keeps his
manure in a heap through the summer,
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81" id = "page81"> </a>
spreads it on the sod in September, or the first week in October. Here
it lies until next spring. The grass and clover grow up through manure,
and the grass and manure are turned under next spring, and the land
planted to corn.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnston is thoroughly convinced that he gets far more benefit
from the manure when applied on the surface, and left exposed for
several months, than if he plowed it under at once.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>I like to write and talk about John Johnston. I&nbsp;like to visit
him. He is so delightfully enthusiastic, believes so thoroughly in good
farming, and has been so eminently successful, that a day spent in his
company can not fail to encourage any farmer to renewed efforts in
improving his soil. “You <i>must</i> drain,” he wrote to me; “when I
first commenced farming, I&nbsp;never made any money until I began to
underdrain.” But it is not underdraining alone that is the cause of his
eminent success. When he bought his farm, “near Geneva,” over fifty
years ago, there was a pile of manure in the yard that had lain there
year after year, until it was, as he said, “as black as my hat.” The
former owner regarded it as a nuisance, and a few months before young
Johnston bought the farm, had given some darkies a cow on condition that
they would draw out this manure. They drew out six loads, took the
cow&mdash;and that was the last seen of them. Johnston drew out this
manure, raised a good crop of wheat, and that gave him a start. He says
he has been asked a great many times to what he owes his success as a
farmer, and he has replied that he could not tell whether it was “dung
or credit.” It was probably neither. It was the man&mdash;his
intelligence, industry, and good common sense. That heap of black mould
was merely an instrument in his hands that he could turn to good
account.</p>

<p>His first crop of wheat gave him “credit” and this also he used to
advantage. He believed that good farming would pay, and it was this
faith in a generous soil that made him willing to spend the money
obtained from the first crop of wheat in enriching the land, and to
avail himself of his credit. Had he lacked this faith&mdash;had he
hoarded every sixpence he could have ground out of the soil, who would
have ever heard of John Johnston? He has been liberal with his crops and
his animals, and has ever found them grateful. This is the real lesson
which his life teaches.</p>

<p>He once wrote me he had something to show me. He did not tell me what
it was, and when I got there, he took me to a field of grass that was to
be mown for hay. The field had been in winter wheat the year before. At
the time of sowing the wheat, the
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82" id = "page82"> </a>
whole field was seeded down with timothy. No clover was sown, either
then or in the spring; but after the wheat was sown, he put on a slight
dressing of manure on two portions of the field that he thought were
poor. He told the man to spread it out of the wagon just as thin as he
could distribute it evenly over the land. It was a very light manuring,
but the manure was rich, and thoroughly rotted. I&nbsp;do not recollect
whether the effect of the manure was particularly noticed on the wheat;
but on the grass, the following spring, the effect was sufficiently
striking. Those two portions of the field where the manure was spread
were <i>covered with a splendid crop of red clover</i>. You could see
the exact line, in both cases, where the manure reached. It looked quite
curious. No clover-seed was sown, and yet there was as fine a crop of
clover as one could desire.</p>

<p>On looking into the matter more closely, we found that there was more
or less clover all over the field, but where the manure was not used, it
could hardly be seen. The plants were small, and the timothy hid them
from view. But where the manure was used, these plants of clover had
been stimulated in their growth until they covered the ground. The
leaves were broad and vigorous, while in the other case they were small,
and almost dried up. This is probably the right explanation. The manure
did not “bring in the clover;” it simply increased the growth of that
already in the soil. It shows the value of manure for grass.</p>

<p>This is what Mr. Johnston wanted to show me. “I&nbsp;might have
written and told you, but you would not have got a clear idea of the
matter.” This is true. One had to see the great luxuriance of that piece
of clover to fully appreciate the effect of the manure. Mr.&nbsp;J. said
the manure on that grass was worth $30 an acre&mdash;that is, on the
three crops of grass, before the field is again plowed. I&nbsp;have no
doubt that this is true, and that the future crops on the land will also
be benefited&mdash;not directly from the manure, perhaps, but from the
clover-roots in the soil. And if the field were pastured, the effect on
future crops would be very decided.</p>

CHAPTER XX.</a></h4>

<h5>MY OWN PLAN OF MANAGING MANURE.</h5>

<p>One of the charms and the advantages of agriculture is that a farmer
must think for himself. He should study principles, and apply them in
practice, as best suits his circumstances.</p>

<p>My own method of managing manure gives me many of the advantages
claimed for the Deacon’s method, and John Johnston’s, also.</p>

<p>“I do not understand what you mean,” said the Deacon; “my method
differs essentially from that of John Johnston.”</p>

<p>“True,” I replied, “you use your winter-made manure in the spring;
while Mr. Johnston piles his, and gets it thoroughly fermented; but to
do this, he has to keep it until the autumn, and it does not benefit his
corn-crop before the next summer. He loses the use of his manure for a
year.”</p>

<p>I think my method secures both these advantages. I&nbsp;get my
winter-made manure fermented and in good condition, and yet have it
ready for spring crops.</p>

<p>In the first place, I should remark that my usual plan is to cut up
all the fodder for horses, cows, and sheep. For horses, I&nbsp;sometimes
use long straw for bedding, but, as a rule, I&nbsp;prefer to run
everything through a feed-cutter. We do not steam the food, and we let
the cows and sheep have a liberal supply of cut corn-stalks and straw,
and what they do not eat is thrown out of the mangers and racks, and
used for bedding.</p>

<p>I should state, too, that I keep a good many pigs, seldom having less
than 50 breeding sows. My pigs are mostly sold at from two to four
months old, but we probably average 150 head the year round. A&nbsp;good
deal of my manure, therefore, comes from the pig-pens, and from two
basement cellars, where my store hogs sleep in winter.</p>

<p>In addition to the pigs, we have on the farm from 150 to 200 Cotswold
and grade sheep; 10 cows, and 8 horses. These are our manure makers.</p>

<p>The raw material from which the manure is manufactured consists of
wheat, barley, rye, and oat-straw, corn-stalks, corn-fodder, clover and
timothy-hay, clover seed-hay, bean-straw, pea-straw, potato-tops,
mangel-wurzel, turnips, rape, and mustard. These are all raised on the
farm; and, in addition to the home-grown oats, peas, and corn, we buy
and feed out considerable quantities
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
of bran, shorts, fine-middlings, malt-combs, corn-meal, and a little
oil-cake. I&nbsp;sell wheat, rye, barley, and clover-seed, apples, and
potatoes, and sometimes cabbages and turnips. Probably, on the average,
for each $100 I receive from the sale of these crops, I&nbsp;purchase
$25 worth of bran, malt-combs, corn-meal, and other feed for animals. My
farm is now rapidly increasing in fertility and productiveness. The
crops, on the average, are certainly at least double what they were when
I bought the farm thirteen years ago; and much of this increase has
taken place during the last five or six years, and I expect to see still
greater improvement year by year.</p>

<p>“Never mind all that,” said the Deacon; “we all know that manure will
enrich land, and I will concede that your farm has greatly improved, and
can not help but improve if you continue to make and use as much
manure.”</p>

<p>“I expect to make more and more manure every year,” said I. “The
larger the crops, the more manure we can make; and the more manure we
make, the larger the crops.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The real point of difference between my plan of managing manure, and
the plan adopted by the Deacon, is essentially this: I&nbsp;aim to keep
all my manure in a compact pile, where it will slowly ferment all
winter. The Deacon throws his horse-manure into a heap, just outside the
stable door, and the cow-manure into another heap, and the pig-manure
into another heap. These heaps are more or less scattered, and are
exposed to the rain, and snow, and frost. The horse-manure is quite
likely to ferment too rapidly, and if in a large heap, and the weather
is warm, it not unlikely “fire-fangs” in the center of the heap. On the
other hand, the cow-manure lies cold and dead, and during the winter
freezes into solid lumps.</p>

<p>I wheel or cart all my manure into one central heap. The main object
is to keep it as compact as possible. There are two advantages in this:
1st, the manure is less exposed to the rain, and (2d), when freezing
weather sets in, only a few inches of the external portion of the heap
is frozen. I&nbsp;have practised this plan for several years, and can
keep my heap of manure slowly fermenting during the whole winter.</p>

<p>But in order to ensure this result, it is necessary to begin making
the heap before winter sets in. The plan is this:</p>

<p>Having selected the spot in the yard most convenient for making the
heap, collect all the manure that can be found in the sheepyards,
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
sheds, cow and horse stables, pig-pens, and hen-house, together with
leaves, weeds, and refuse from the garden, and wheel or cart it to the
intended heap. If you set a farm-man to do the work, tell him you want
to make a hot-bed about five feet high, six feet wide, and six feet
long. I&nbsp;do not think I have ever seen a farm where enough material
could not be found, say in November, to make such a heap. And this is
all that is needed. If the manure is rich, if it is obtained from
animals eating clover-hay, bran, grain, or other food rich in nitrogen,
it will soon ferment. But if the manure is poor, consisting largely of
straw, it will be very desirable to make it richer by mixing with it
bone-dust, blood, hen-droppings, woollen rags, chamber-lye, and animal
matter of any kind that you can find.</p>

<p>The richer you can make the manure, the more readily will it ferment.
A&nbsp;good plan is to take the horse or sheep manure, a&nbsp;few weeks
previous, and use it for bedding the pigs. It will absorb the liquid of
the pigs, and make rich manure, which will soon ferment when placed in a
heap.</p>

<p>If the manure in the heap is too dry, it is a good plan, when you are
killing hogs, to throw on to the manure all the warm water, hair, blood,
intestines, etc. You may think I am making too much of such a simple
matter, but I have had letters from farmers who have tried this plan of
managing manure, and they say that they can not keep it from freezing.
One reason for this is, that they do not start the heap early enough,
and do not take pains to get the manure into an active fermentation
before winter sets in. Much depends on this. In starting a fire, you
take pains to get a little fine, dry wood, that will burn readily, and
when the fire is fairly going, put on larger sticks, and presently you
have such a fire that you can burn wood, coal, stubble, sods, or
anything you wish. And so it is with a manure-heap. Get the fire, or
fermentation, or, more strictly speaking, putrefaction fairly started,
and there will be little trouble, if the heap is large enough, and fresh
material is added from time to time, of continuing the fermentation all
winter.</p>

<p>Another point to be observed, and especially in cold weather, is to
keep the sides of the heap straight, and the <i>top level</i>. You must
expose the manure in the heap as little as possible to frost and cold
winds. The rule should be to spread every wheel-barrowful of manure as
soon as it is put on the heap. If left unspread on top of the heap, it
will freeze; and if afterwards covered with other manure, it will
require considerable heat to melt it, and thus reduce the temperature of
the whole heap.</p>

It is far less work to manage a heap of manure in this way than may be
supposed from my description of the plan. The truth is, I&nbsp;find, in
point of fact, that it is <i>not</i> an easy thing to manage manure in
this way; and I fear not one farmer in ten will succeed the first winter
he undertakes it, unless he gives it his personal attention. It is well
worth trying, however, because if your heap should freeze up, it will
be, at any rate, in no worse condition than if managed in the ordinary
way; and if you do succeed, even in part, you will have manure in good
condition for immediate use in the spring.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>As I have said before, I keep a good many pigs. Now pigs, if fed on
slops, void a large quantity of liquid manure, and it is not always easy
to furnish straw enough to absorb it. When straw and stalks are cut into
chaff, they will absorb much more liquid than when used whole. For this
reason we usually cut all our straw and stalks. We also use the litter
from the horse-stable for bedding the store hogs, and also sometimes,
when comparatively dry, we use the refuse sheep bedding for the same
purpose. Where the sheep barn is contiguous to the pig-pens, and when
the sheep bedding can be thrown at once into the pig-pens or cellar, it
is well to use bedding freely for the sheep and lambs, and remove it
frequently, throwing it into the pig-pens. I&nbsp;do not want my sheep
to be compelled to eat up the straw and corn-stalks too close.
I&nbsp;want them to pick out what they like, and then throw away what
they leave in the troughs for bedding. Sometimes we take out a
five-bushel basketful of these direct from the troughs, for bedding
young pigs, or sows and pigs in the pens, but as a rule, we use them
first for bedding the sheep, and then afterwards use the sheep bedding
in the fattening or store pig-pens.</p>

<p>“And sometimes,” remarked the Deacon, “you use a little long straw
for your young pigs to sleep on, so that they can bury themselves in the
straw and keep warm.”</p>

<p>“True,” I replied, “and it is not a bad plan, but we are not now
talking about the management of pigs, but how we treat our manure, and
how we manage to have it ferment all winter.”</p>

<p>A good deal of our pig-manure is, to borrow a phrase from the
pomologists, “double-worked.” It is horse or sheep-manure, used for
bedding pigs and cows. It is saturated with urine, and is much richer in
nitrogenous material than ordinary manure, and consequently will ferment
or <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘putrify’">putrefy</ins> much more rapidly.
Usually pig-manure is considered “cold,” or sluggish, but this doubleworked
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>
pig-manure will ferment even more rapidly than sheep or horse-manure
alone.</p>

<p>Unmixed cow-manure is heavy and cold, and when kept in a heap by
itself out of doors, is almost certain to freeze up solid during the
winter.</p>

<p>We usually wheel out our cow-dung every day, and spread on the manure
heap.</p>

<p>This is one of the things that needs attention. There will be a
constant tendency to put all the cow-dung together, instead of mixing it
with the lighter and more active manure from the horses, sheep, and
pigs. Spread it out and cover it with some of the more strawy manure,
which is not so liable to freeze.</p>

<p>Should it so happen&mdash;as will most likely be the case&mdash;that
on looking at your heap some morning when the thermometer is below zero,
you find that several wheel-barrowfuls of manure that were put on the
heap the day before, were not spread, and are now crusted over with ice,
it will be well to break up the barrowfuls, even if necessary to use a
crowbar, and place the frozen lumps of manure on the outside of the
heap, rather than to let them lie in the center of the pile. Your aim
should be always to keep the center of the heap warm and in a state of
fermentation. You do not want the fire to go out, and it will not go out
if the heap is properly managed, even should all the sides and top be
crusted over with a layer of frozen manure.</p>

<p>During very severe weather, and when the top is frozen, it is a good
plan, when you are about to wheel some fresh manure on to the heap, to
remove a portion of the frozen crust on top of the heap, near the
center, and make a hole for the fresh manure, which should be spread and
covered up.</p>

<p>When the heap is high enough, say five feet, we commence another heap
alongside. In doing this, our plan is to clean out some of the
sheep-sheds or pig-pens, where the manure has accumulated for some time.
This gives us much more than the daily supply. Place this manure on the
outside of the new heap, and then take a quantity of hot, fermenting,
manure from the middle of the old heap, and throw it into the center of
the new heap, and then cover it up with the fresh manure. I&nbsp;would
put in eight or ten bushels, or as much as will warm up the center of
the new heap, and start fermentation. The colder the weather, the more
of this hot manure should you take from the old heap&mdash;the more the
better. Fresh manure should be added to the old heap to fill up the hole
made by the removal of the hot manure.</p>

“You draw out a great many loads of manure during the winter,” said the
Deacon, “and pile it in the field, and I have always thought it a good
plan, as you do the work when there is little else to do, and when the
ground is frozen.”</p>

<p>Yes, this is an improvement on my old plan. I&nbsp;formerly used to
turn over the heap of manure in the barn-yard in March, or as soon as
fermentation had ceased.</p>

<p>The object of turning the heap is (1st,) to mix the manure and make
it of uniform quality; (2d,) to break the lumps and make the manure
fine; and (3d,) to lighten up the manure and make it loose, thus letting
in the air and inducing a second fermentation. It is a good plan, and
well repays for the labor. In doing the work, build up the end and sides
of the new heap straight, and keep the top flat. Have an eye on the man
doing the work, and see that he breaks up the manure and mixes it
thoroughly, and that he <i>goes to the bottom of the heap</i>.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>My new plan that the Deacon alludes to, is, instead of turning the
heap in the yard, to draw the manure from the heap in the yard, and pile
it up in another heap in the field where it is to be used. This has all
the effects of turning, and at the same time saves a good deal of
team-work in the spring.</p>

alt = "diagram of field with manure heaps"><br>
<i>A, B, Manure Heaps; C, D, E,<br>
Ridges, 2½ ft. apart.</i></span>
The location of the manure-heap in the field deserves some
consideration. If the manure is to be used for root-crops or potatoes,
and if the land is to be ridged, and the manure put in the ridges, then
it will be desirable to put the heap on the headland, or, better still,
to make two heaps, one on the headland top of the field, and the other
on the headland at the bottom of the field, as shown in the annexed
engraving.</p>

<p>We draw the manure with a cart, the horse walking between two of the
ridges (D), and the wheels of the cart going in C and E. The manure is
pulled out at the back end of the cart into small heaps, about five
paces apart.</p>

<p>“That is what I object to with you agricultural writers,” said the
Doctor; “you say ‘about five paces,’ and sometimes ‘about five paces<ins
class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">’ </ins>would mean 4
yards, and sometimes 6 yards; and if you
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
put 10 tons of manure per acre in the one case, you would put 15 tons in
the other&mdash;which makes quite a difference in the&nbsp;dose.”</p>

<p>The Doctor is right. Let us figure a little. If your cart holds 20
bushels, and if the manure weighs 75 lbs. to the bushel, and you wish to
put on 10 tons of manure per acre, or 1,500 bushels, or 13⅓ cart-loads,
then, as there are 43,560 square feet in an acre, you want a bushel of
manure to 29 square feet, or say a space 2 yards long, by nearly 5
feet&nbsp;wide.</p>

<p>Now, as our ridges are 2½ feet apart, and as our usual plan is to
manure 5 ridges at a time, or 12½ feet wide, a&nbsp;load of 20 bushels
of manure will go over a space 46½ feet long, nearly, or say 15½ yards;
and so, a&nbsp;load would make 3 heaps, 15½ feet apart, and there would
be 6⅔ bushels in each heap.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>If the manure is to be spread on the surface of the land, there is no
necessity for placing the heap on the headland. You can make the heap or
heaps. &mdash;“Where most convenient,” broke in the Deacon. &mdash;“No,
not by any means,” I replied; “for if that was the rule, the men would
certainly put the heap just where it happened to be the least trouble
for them to draw and throw off the loads.”</p>

<p>The aim should be to put the heap just where it will require the
least labor to draw the manure on to the land in the spring.</p>

<p>On what we call “rolling,” or hilly land, I&nbsp;would put the heap
on the highest land, so that in the spring the horses would be going
down hill with the full carts or wagons. Of course, it would be very
unwise to adopt this plan if the manure was not drawn from the yards
until spring, when the land was soft; but I am now speaking of drawing
out the manure in the winter, when there is sleighing, or when the
ground is frozen. No farmer will object to a little extra labor for the
teams in the winter, if it will save work and time in the spring.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">90</span>

If the land is level, then the heap or heaps should be placed where the
least distance will have to be traveled in drawing the manure from the
heap to the land. If there is only one heap, the best point would be in
the center of the field. If two heaps, and the field is longer than it
is broad, say 20 rods wide, and 40 rods long, then the heaps should be
made as shown on the previous page.</p>

<p>If the field is square, say 40 ×&nbsp;40 rods, and we can have four
heaps of manure, then, other things being equal, the best points for the
heaps are shown in the annexed figure:</p>

<p class = "illustration">

alt = "square field"><br>
<i>Field, 40×40 Rods, showing Position of four Heaps of Manure, a, a,
a,&nbsp;a.</i></p>

<p>Having determined where to make the heaps, the next question is in
regard to size. We make one about 8 feet wide and 6 feet high, the
length being determined by the quantity of the manure we have to draw.
In cold weather, it is well to finish the heap each day as far as you
go, so that the sloping side at the end of the heap will not be frozen
during the night. Build up the sides square, so that the top of the heap
shall be as broad as the bottom. You will have to see that this is done,
for the average farm-man, if left to himself, will certainly narrow up
the heap like the roof of a house. The reason he does this is that he
throws the manure from the load into the center of the heap, and he can
not build up the sides straight and square without getting on to the
heap occasionally, and placing a layer round the outsides. He
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<a name = "page91" id = "page91"> </a>
should be instructed, too, to break up the lumps, and mix the manure,
working it over until it is loose and fine. It there are any frozen
masses of manure, place them on the east or south outside, and not in
the middle of the heap.</p>

<p>If there is any manure in the sheds, or basements, or cellars, or
pig-pens, clean it out, and draw it at once to the pile in the field,
and mix it with the manure you are drawing from the heap in the
yard.</p>

<p>We generally draw with two teams and three wagons. We have one man to
fill the wagon in the yard, and two men to drive and unload. When the
man comes back from the field, he places his empty wagon by the side of
the heap in the yard, and takes off the horses and puts them to the
loaded wagon, and drives to the heap in the field. If we have men and
teams enough, we draw with three teams and three wagons. In this case,
we put a reliable man at the heap, who helps the driver to unload, and
sees that the heap is built properly. The driver helps the man in the
yard to load up. In the former plan, we have two teams and three men; in
the latter case, we have three teams and five men, and as we have two
men loading and unloading, instead of one, we ought to draw out double
the quantity of manure in a day. If the weather is cold and windy, we
put the blankets on the horses under the harness, so that they will not
be chilled while standing at the heap in the yard or field. They will
trot back lively with the empty wagon or sleigh, and the work will
proceed briskly, and the manure be less exposed to the cold.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“You do not,” said the Doctor, “draw the manure on to the heap with a
cart, and dump it, as I have seen it done in England?”</p>

<p>I did so a few years ago, and might do so again if I was piling
manure in the spring, to be kept over summer for use in the fall. The
compression caused by drawing the cart over the manure, has a tendency
to exclude the air and thus retard fermentation. In the winter there is
certainly no necessity for resorting to any means for checking
fermentation. In the spring or summer it may be well to compress the
heap a little, but not more, I&nbsp;think, than can be done by the
trampling of the workman in spreading the manure on the heap.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“You do not,” said the Doctor, “adopt the old-fashioned English plan
of keeping your manure in a basin in the barn-yard, and yet I should
think it has some advantages.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92" id = "page92"> </a>
“I&nbsp;practised it here,” said I, “for some years. I&nbsp;plowed and
scraped a large hole or basin in the yard four or five feet deep, with a
gradual slope at one end for convenience in drawing out the
loads&mdash;the other sides being much steeper. I&nbsp;also made a tank
at the bottom to hold the drainage, and had a pump in it to pump the
liquid back on to the heap in dry weather. We threw or wheeled the
manure from the stables and pig-pens into this basin, but I did not like
the plan, for two reasons: (1,) the manure being spread over so large a
surface froze during winter, and (2,) during the spring there was so
much water in the basin that it checked fermentation.”</p>

<p>Now, instead of spreading it all over the basin, we commenced a small
heap on one of the sloping sides of the basin; with a horse and cart we
drew to this heap, just as winter set in, every bit of manure that could
be found on the premises, and everything that would make manure. When
got all together, it made a heap seven or eight feet wide, twenty feet
long, and three or four feet high. We then laid planks on the heap, and
every day, as the pig-pens, cow and horse stables were cleaned out, the
manure was wheeled on to the heap and shaken out and spread about. The
heap soon commenced to ferment, and when the cold weather set in,
although the sides and some parts of the top froze a little, the inside
kept quite warm. Little chimneys were formed in the heap, where the heat
and steam escaped. Other parts of the heap would be covered with a thin
crust of frozen manure. By taking a few forkfuls of the latter, and
placing them on the top of the “chimneys,” they checked the escape of
steam, and had a tendency to distribute the heat to other parts of the
heap. In this way the fermentation became more general throughout all
the mass, and not so violent at any one spot.</p>

<p>“But why be at all this trouble?”&mdash;For several reasons. First.
It saves labor in the end. Two hours’ work, in winter, will save three
hours’ work in the spring. And three hours’ work in the spring is worth
more than four hours’ work in the winter. So that we save half the
expense of handling the manure. 2d. When manure is allowed to lie
scattered about over a large surface, it is liable to have much of its
value washed out by the rain. In a compact heap of this kind, the rain
or snow that falls on it is not more than the manure needs to keep it
moist enough for fermentation. 3d. There is as much fascination in this
fermenting heap of manure as there is in having money in a savings bank.
One is continually trying to add to it. Many a cart-load or
wheel-barrowful of material will be deposited that would otherwise be
allowed
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93" id = "page93"> </a>
to run to waste. 4th. The manure, if turned over in February or March,
will be in capital order for applying to root crops; or if your hay and
straw contains weed-seeds, the manure will be in good condition to
spread as a top-dressing on grass-land early in the spring. This,
I&nbsp;think, is better than keeping it in the yards all summer, and
then drawing it out on the grass land in September. You gain six months’
or a year’s time. You get a splendid growth of rich grass, and the
red-root seeds will germinate next September just as well as if the
manure was drawn out at that time. If the manure is drawn out early in
the spring, and spread out immediately, and then harrowed two or three
times with a Thomas’ smoothing-harrow, there is no danger of its
imparting a rank flavor to the grass. I&nbsp;know from repeated trials
that when part of a pasture is top-dressed, cows and sheep will keep it
much more closely cropped down than the part which has not been manured.
The idea to the contrary originated from not spreading the manure
evenly.</p>

<p>“But why ferment the manure at all? Why not draw it out fresh from
the yards? Does fermentation increase the amount of plant-food in the
manure?”&mdash;No. But it renders the plant-food in the manure more
immediately available. It makes it more soluble. We ferment manure for
the same reason that we decompose bone-dust or mineral phosphates with
sulphuric acid, and convert them into superphosphate, or for the same
reason that we grind our corn and cook the meal. These processes add
nothing to the amount of plant-food in the bones or the nutriment in the
corn. They only increase its availability. So in fermenting manure. When
the liquid and solid excrements from well-fed animals, with the straw
necessary to absorb the liquid, are placed in a heap, fermentation sets
in and soon effects very important changes in the nature and composition
of the materials. The insoluble woody fibre of the straw is decomposed
and converted into humic and ulmic acids. These are insoluble; and when
manure consists almost wholly of straw or corn stalks, there would be
little gained by fermenting it. But when there is a good proportion of
manure from well fed animals in the heap, carbonate of ammonia is formed
from the nitrogenous compounds in the manure, and this ammonia unites
with the humic and ulmic acids and forms humate and ulmate of ammonia.
These ammoniacal salts are soluble in water&mdash;as the brown color of
the drainings of a manure heap sufficiently indicates.</p>

<p>Properly fermented manure, therefore, of good quality, is a much more
active and immediately useful fertilizer than fresh, unfermented
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<a name = "page94" id = "page94"> </a>
manure. There need be no loss of ammonia from evaporation, and the
manure is far less bulky, and costs far less labor to draw out and
spread. The only loss that is likely to occur is from leaching, and this
must be specially guarded against.</p>

<h6 class = "section">WHY DO WE FERMENT MANURE?</h6>

<p>However much farmers may differ in regard to the advantages or
disadvantages of fermenting manure, I&nbsp;have never met with one who
contended that it was good, either in theory or practice, to leave
manure for months, scattered over a barn-yard, exposed to the spring and
autumn rains, and to the summer’s sun and wind. All admit that, if it is
necessary to leave manure in the yards, it should be either thrown into
a basin, or put into a pile or heap, where it will be compact, and not
much exposed.</p>

<p>We did not need the experiments of Dr. Vœlcker to convince us that
there was great waste in leaving manure exposed to the leaching action
of our heavy rains. We did not know exactly how much we lost, but we
knew it must be considerable. No one advocates the practice of exposing
manure, and it is of no use to discuss the matter. All will admit that
it is unwise and wasteful to allow manure to lie scattered and exposed
over the barn-yards any longer than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>We should either draw it directly to the field and use it, or we
should make it into a compact heap, where it will not receive more rain
than is needed to keep it moist.</p>

<p>One reason for piling manure, therefore, is to preserve it from loss,
until we wish to use it on the land.</p>

<p>“We all admit that,” said the Deacon, “but is there anything actually
gained by fermenting it in the heap?”&mdash;In one sense, no; but in
another, and very important sense, yes. When we cook corn-meal for our
little pigs, we add nothing to it. We have no more meal after it is
cooked than before. There are no more starch, or oil, or nitrogenous
matters in the meal, but we think the pigs can digest the food more
readily. And so, in fermenting
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95" id = "page95"> </a>
manure, we add nothing to it; there is no more actual nitrogen, or
phosphoric acid, or potash, or any other ingredient after fermentation
than there was before, but these ingredients are rendered more soluble,
and can be more rapidly taken up by the plants. In this sense,
therefore, there is a great gain.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, we do not, in many cases, get anything like as
much benefit from our manure as the ingredients it contains would lead
us to expect.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawes, on his clayey soil at Rothamsted, England, has grown over
thirty crops of wheat, year after year, on the same land. One plot has
received 14 tons of barn-yard manure per acre every year, and yet the
produce from this plot is no larger, and, in fact, is frequently much
less, than from a few hundred pounds of artificial manure containing far
less nitrogen.</p>

<p>For nineteen years, 1852 to 1870, some of the plots have received the

<p>The 14 tons (31,360 lbs.) of farm-yard manure contained about 8,540

400 lbs. of ammoniacal salts, and the 550 lbs. nitrate of soda, each
contained 82 lbs. of nitrogen; and it will be seen that this 82 lbs. of
nitrogen produced as great an effect as the 200 lbs. of nitrogen in
barn-yard manure.</p>

<p>Similar experiments have been made on barley, with even more striking
results. The plot dressed with 300 lbs. superphosphate of lime, and 200
lbs. ammoniacal salts per acre, produced as large a crop as 14 tons of
farm-yard manure. The average yield of barley for nineteen crops grown
on the same land each year was 48 bus. and 28 cwt. of straw per acre on
both plots. In other words, 41 lbs. of nitrogen, in ammoniacal salts,
produced as great an effect as 200 lbs. of nitrogen in farm-yard manure!
During the nineteen years, one plot had received 162,260 lbs. of organic
matter, 16,492 lbs. of mineral matter, and 3,800 lbs. of nitrogen; while
the other had received only 5,700 lbs. mineral matter, and 779 lbs. of
nitrogen&mdash;and yet one has produced as large a crop as the
other.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<a name = "page96" id = "page96"> </a>
Why this difference? It will not do to say that more nitrogen was
applied in the farm-yard manure than was needed. Mr. Lawes says: “For
some years, an amount of ammonia-salts, containing 82 lbs. of nitrogen,
was applied to one series of plots (of barley), but this was found to be
too much, the crop generally being too heavy and laid. Yet probably
about 200 lbs. of nitrogen was annually supplied in the dung, but with
it there was no over-luxuriance, and no more crop, than where 41 lbs. of
nitrogen was supplied in the form of ammonia or nitric acid.”</p>

<p>It would seem that there can be but one explanation of these
accurately-ascertained facts. The nitrogenous matter in the manure is
not in an available condition. It is in the manure, but the plants can
not take it up until it is decomposed and rendered soluble. Dr. Vœlcker
analyzed “perfectly fresh horse-dung,” and found that of <i>free</i>
ammonia there was not more than one pound in 15 tons! And yet these 15
tons contained nitrogen enough to furnish 140 lbs. of ammonia.</p>

<p>“But,” it may be asked, “will not this fresh manure decompose in the
soil, and furnish ammonia?” In light, sandy soil, I&nbsp;presume it will
do so to a considerable extent. We know that clay mixed with manure
retards fermentation, but sand mixed with manure accelerates
fermentation. This, at any rate, is the case when sand is added in small
quantities to a heap of fermenting manure. But I do not suppose it would
have the same effect when a small quantity of manure is mixed with a
large amount of sand, as is the case when manure is applied to land, and
plowed under. At any rate, practical farmers, with almost entire
unanimity, think well-rotted manure is better for sandy land than fresh
manure.</p>

<p>As to how rapidly, or rather how slowly, manure decomposes in a
rather heavy loamy soil, the above experiments of Mr. Lawes afford very
conclusive, but at the same time very discouraging evidence. During the
19 years, 3,800 lbs. of nitrogen, and 16,492 lbs. of mineral matter, in
the form of farm-yard manure, were applied to an acre of land, and the
19 crops of barley in grain and straw removed only 3,724 lbs. of mineral
matter, and 1,064 lbs. of nitrogen. The soil now contains, unless it has
drained away, 1,736 lbs. more nitrogen per acre than it did when the
experiments commenced. And yet 41 lbs. of nitrogen in an <i>available
condition</i> is sufficient to produce a good large crop of barley, and
82 lbs. per acre furnished more than the plants could organize.</p>

<p>“Those are very interesting experiments,” said the Doctor, “and show
why it is that our farmers can afford to pay a higher price for nitrogen
and phosphoric acid in superphosphate, and other artificial
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>
manures, than for the same amount of nitrogen and phosphoric acid in
stable-manure.”</p>

<p>We will not discuss this point at present. What I want to ascertain
is, whether we can not find some method of making our farm-yard manure
more readily available. Piling it up, and letting it ferment, is one
method of doing this, though I think other methods will yet be
discovered. Possibly it will be found that spreading well-rotted manure
on the surface of the land will be one of the most practical and
simplest methods of accomplishing this object.</p>

<p>“We pile the manure, therefore,” said Charley, “first, because we do
not wish it to lie exposed to the rain in the yards, and, second,
because fermenting it in the heap renders it more soluble, and otherwise
more available for the crops, when applied to the land.”</p>

<p>That is it exactly, and another reason for piling manure is, that the
fermentation greatly reduces its bulk, and we have less labor to perform
in drawing it out and spreading it. Ellwanger &amp; Barry, who draw
several thousand loads of stable-manure every year, and pile it up to
ferment, tell me that it takes three loads of fresh manure to make one
load of rotted manure. This, of course, has reference to bulk, and not
weight. Three tons of fresh barn-yard manure, according to the
experiments of Dr. Vœlcker, will make about two tons when well rotted.
Even this is a great saving of labor, and the rotted manure can be more
easily spread, and mixed more thoroughly with the soil&mdash;a point of
great importance.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“Another reason for fermenting manure,” said the Squire, “is the
destruction of weed-seeds.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said I, “and a very important reason; but I try not
to think about this method of killing weed-seeds. It is a great deal
better to kill the weeds. There can be no doubt that a fermenting
manure-heap will kill many of the weed-seeds, but enough will usually
escape to re-seed the land.”</p>

<p>It is fortunate, however, that the best means to kill weed-seeds in
the manure, are also the best for rendering the manure most efficient.
I&nbsp;was talking to John Johnston on this subject a few days ago. He
told me how he piled manure in his yards.</p>

<p>“I commence,” he said, “where the heap is intended to be, and throw
the manure on one side, until the bare ground is reached.”</p>

<p>“What is the use of that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“If you do not do so,” he replied, “there will be some portion of
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page98" id = "page98"> </a>
the manure under the heap that will be so compact that it will not
ferment, and the weed-seeds will not be killed.”</p>

<p>“You think,” said I, “that weed-seeds can be killed in this way?”</p>

<p>“I know they can,” he replied, “but the heap must be carefully made,
so that it will ferment evenly, and when the pile is turned, the bottom
and sides should be thrown into the center of the heap.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">LOSS OF AMMONIA BY FERMENTING MANURE.</h6>

<p>If you throw a quantity of fresh horse-manure into a loose heap,
fermentation proceeds with great rapidity. Much heat is produced, and if
the manure is under cover, or there is not rain enough to keep the heap
moist, the manure will “fire-fang” and a large proportion of the
carbonate of ammonia produced by the fermentation will escape into the
atmosphere and be lost.</p>

<p>As I have said before, we use our horse-manure for bedding the store
and fattening pigs. We throw the manure every morning and evening, when
the stable is cleaned out, into an empty stall near the door of the
stable, and there it remains until wanted to bed the pigs. We find it is
necessary to remove it frequently, especially in the summer, as
fermentation soon sets in, and the escape of the ammonia is detected by
its well known pungent smell. Throw this manure into the pig-cellar and
let the pigs trample it down, and there is no longer any escape of
ammonia. At any rate, I&nbsp;have never perceived any. Litmus paper will
detect ammonia in an atmosphere containing only one seventy-five
thousandth part of it; and, as Prof. S.&nbsp;W. Johnson once remarked,
“It is certain that a healthy nose is not far inferior in delicacy to
litmus paper.” I feel sure that no ammonia escapes from this
horse-manure after it is trampled down by the pigs, although it contains
an additional quantity of “potential ammonia” from the liquid and solid
droppings of these animals.</p>

<p>Water has a strong attraction for ammonia. One gallon of ice-cold
water will absorb 1,150 gallons of ammonia.</p>

<p>If the manure, therefore, is moderately moist, the ammonia is not
likely to escape. Furthermore, as Dr. Vœlcker has shown us, during the
fermentation of the manure in a heap, ulmic and humic, crenic and <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘aprocrenic’">apocrenic</ins>
acids are produced, and these unite with the ammonia and “fix”
it&mdash;in other words, they change it from a volatile gas into a
non-volatile salt.</p>

<p>If the heap of manure, therefore, is moist enough and large enough,
all the evidence goes to show, that there is little or no loss of
ammonia. If the centre of the heap gets so hot and so dry that the
ammonia is not retained, there is still no necessity for loss.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page99" id = "page99"> </a>
The sides of the heap are cool and moist, and will retain the carbonate
of ammonia, the acids mentioned also coming into play.</p>

<p>The ammonia is much more likely to escape from the top of the heap
than from the sides. The heat and steam form little chimneys, and when a
fermenting manure-heap is covered with snow, these little chimneys are
readily seen. If you think the manure is fermenting too rapidly, and
that the ammonia is escaping, trample the manure down firmly about the
chimneys, thus closing them up, and if need be, or if convenient, throw
more manure on top, or throw on a few pailfuls of water.</p>

<p>It is a good plan, too, where convenient, to cover the heap with
soil. I&nbsp;sometimes do this when piling manure in the field, not from
fear of losing ammonia, but in order to retain moisture in the heap.
With proper precautions, I&nbsp;think we may safely dismiss the idea of
any serious loss of ammonia from fermenting manure.</p>


<h6 class = "section">THE WASTE OF MANURE FROM LEACHING.</h6>

<p>As we have endeavored to show, there is little danger of losing
ammonia by keeping and fermenting manure. But this is not the only
question to be considered. We have seen that in 10,000 lbs. of fresh
farm-yard manure, there is about 64 lbs. of nitrogen. Of this, about 15
lbs. are soluble, and 49 lbs. insoluble. Of mineral matter, we have in
this quantity of manure, 559 lbs., of which 154 lbs. are soluble in
water, and 405 lbs. insoluble. If we had a heap of five tons of
fermenting manure in a stable, the escape of half an ounce of carbonate
of ammonia would make a tremendous smell, and we should at once use
means to check the escape of this precious substance. But it will be
seen that we have in this five tons of fresh manure, nitrogenous matter,
capable of forming over 180 lbs. of carbonate of ammonia, over 42 lbs.
of which is in a soluble condition. This may be leached day after day,
slowly and imperceptibly, with no heat, or smell, to attract
attention.</p>

<p>How often do we see manure lying under the eaves of an unspouted shed
or barn, where one of our heavy showers will saturate it in a few
minutes, and yet where it will lie for hours, and days, and weeks, until
it would seem that a large proportion of its soluble matter would be
washed out of it! The loss is unquestionably very great, and would be
greater if it were not for the coarse nature of the material, which
allows the water to pass through it rapidly and without coming in direct
contact with only the outside portions of the particles of hay, straw,
etc., of which the manure is largely composed. If the manure was ground
up very fine, as it would be when prepared for analysis, the loss of
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<a name = "page100" id = "page100"> </a>
soluble matter would be still more serious. Or, if the manure was first
fermented, so that the particles of matter would be more or less
decomposed and broken up fine, the rain would wash out a large amount of
soluble matter, and prove much more injurious than if the manure was
fresh and unfermented.</p>

<p>“That is an argument,” said the Deacon, “against your plan of piling
and fermenting manure.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I replied; “it is a strong reason for not letting
manure lie under the eaves of an unspouted building&mdash;especially
<i>good</i> manure, that is made from rich food. The better the manure,
the more it will lose from bad management. I&nbsp;have never recommended
any one to pile their manure where it would receive from ten to twenty
times as much water as would fall on the surface of the heap.”</p>

<p>“But you do recommend piling manure and fermenting it in the open air
and keeping the top flat, so that it will catch all the rain, and I
think your heaps must sometimes get pretty well soaked.”</p>

<p>“Soaking the heap of manure,” I replied, “does not wash out any of
its soluble matter, <i>provided</i> you carry the matter no further than
the point of saturation. The water may, and doubtless does, wash out the
soluble matter from some portions of the manure, but if the water does
not filter through the heap, but is all absorbed by the manure, there is
no loss. It is when the water passes through the heap that it runs away
with our soluble nitrogenous and mineral matter, and with any ready
formed ammonia it may find in the manure.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>How to keep cows tied up in the barn, and at the same time save all
the urine, is one of the most difficult problems I have to deal with in
the management of manure on my farm. The best plan I have yet tried is,
to throw horse-manure, or sheep-manure, back of the cows, where it will
receive and absorb the urine. The plan works well, but it is a question
of labor, and the answer will depend on the arrangement of the
buildings. If the horses are kept near the cows, it will be little
trouble to throw the horse-litter, every day, under or back of the
cows.</p>

<p>In my own case, my cows are kept in a basement, with a tight
barn-floor overhead. When this barn-floor is occupied with sheep, we
keep them well-bedded with straw, and it is an easy matter to throw this
soiled bedding down to the cow-stable below, where it is used to absorb
the urine of the cows, and is then wheeled out to the manure-heap in the
yard.</p>

<p>At other times, we use dry earth as an absorbent.</p>

CHAPTER XXII.</a></h4>

<h5>MANURE ON DAIRY-FARMS.</h5>

<p>Farms devoted principally to dairying ought to be richer and more
productive than farms largely devoted to the production of grain.</p>

<p>Nearly all the produce of the farm is used to feed the cows, and
little is sold but milk, or cheese, or butter.</p>

<p>When butter alone is sold, there ought to be no loss of fertilizing
matter&mdash;as pure butter or oil contains no nitrogen, phosphoric
acid, or potash. It contains nothing but carbonaceous matter, which can
be removed from the farm without detriment.</p>

<p>And even in the case of milk, or cheese, the advantage is all on the
side of the dairyman, as compared with the grain-grower. A&nbsp;dollar’s
worth of milk or cheese removes far less nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and
potash, than a dollar’s worth of wheat or other grain. Five hundred lbs.
of cheese contains about 25 lbs. of nitrogen, and 20 lbs. of mineral
matter. A&nbsp;cow that would make this amount of cheese would eat not
less than six tons of hay, or its equivalent in grass or grain, in a
year. And this amount of food, supposing it to be half clover and half
ordinary meadow-hay, would contain 240 lbs. of nitrogen and 810 lbs. of
mineral matter. In other words, a&nbsp;cow eats 240 lbs. of nitrogen,
and 25 lbs. are removed in the cheese, or not quite 10½ per cent, and of
mineral matter not quite 2½ per cent is removed. If it takes three acres
to produce this amount of food, there will be 8⅓ lbs. of nitrogen
removed by the cheese, per acre, while 30 bushels of wheat would remove
in the grain 32 lbs. of nitrogen, and 10 to 15 lbs. in the straw. So
that a crop of wheat removes from five to six times as much nitrogen per
acre as a crop of cheese; and the removal of mineral matter in cheese is
quite insignificant as compared with the amount removed in a crop of
wheat or corn. If our grain-growing farmers can keep up the fertility of
their land, as they undoubtedly can, the dairymen ought to be making
theirs richer and more productive every year.</p>

<p>“All that is quite true,” said the Doctor, “and yet from what I have
seen and heard, the farms in the dairy districts, do not, as a rule,
show any rapid improvement. In fact, we hear it often alleged that the
soil is becoming exhausted of phosphates, and that the quantity and
quality of the grass is deteriorating.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<a name = "page102" id = "page102"> </a>
“There may be some truth in this,” said I, “and yet I will hazard the
prediction that in no other branch of agriculture shall we witness a
more decided improvement during the next twenty-five years than on farms
largely devoted to the dairy. Grain-growing farmers, like our friend the
Deacon, here, who sells his grain and never brings home a load of
manure, and rarely buys even a ton of bran to feed to stock, and who
sells more or less hay, must certainly be impoverishing their soils of
phosphates much more rapidly than the dairyman who consumes nearly all
his produce on the farm, and sells little except milk, butter, cheese,
young calves, and old cows.”</p>

<p>“Bones had a wonderful effect,” said the Doctor, “on the old pastures
in the dairy district of Cheshire in England.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” I replied, “and so they will here, and so would
well-rotted manure. There is nothing in this fact to prove that dairying
specially robs the soil of phosphates. It is not phosphates that the
dairyman needs so much as richer manure.”</p>

<p>“What would you add to the manure to make it richer?” asked the
Doctor.</p>

<p>“Nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash,” I replied.</p>

<p>“But how?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said the Doctor, “by buying guano and the German potash
salts.”</p>

<p>“That would be a good plan,” said I; “but I would do it by buying
bran, mill-feed, brewer’s-grains, malt-combs, corn-meal, oil-cake, or
whatever was best and cheapest in proportion to value. Bran or mill-feed
can often be bought at a price at which it will pay to use it freely for
manure. A&nbsp;few tons of bran worked into a pile of cow-dung would
warm it up and add considerably to its value. It would supply the
nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, in which ordinary manure is
deficient. In short, it would convert poor manure into rich manure.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” exclaimed the Deacon, “I&nbsp;knew you talked of mixing
dried-blood and bone-dust with your manure, but I did not think you
would advocate anything quite so extravagant as taking good, wholesome
bran and spout-feed and throwing it on to your manure-pile.”</p>

<p>“Why, Deacon,” said I, “we do it every day. I&nbsp;am putting about a
ton of spout-feed, malt-combs and corn-meal each week into my
manure-pile, and that is the reason why it ferments so readily even in
the winter. It converts my poor manure into good, rich, well-decomposed
dung, one load of which is worth three loads of your long, strawy
manure.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<a name = "page103" id = "page103"> </a>
“Do you not wet it and let it ferment before putting it in the
pile?”</p>

<p>“No, Deacon,” said I, “I feed the bran, malt-combs and corn-meal to
the cows, pigs, and sheep, and let them do the mixing. They work it up
fine, moisten it, break up the particles, take out the carbonaceous
matter, which we do not need for manure, and the cows and sheep and
horses mix it up thoroughly with the hay, straw, and corn-stalks,
leaving the whole in just the right condition to put into a pile to
ferment or to apply directly to the land.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see,” said the Deacon, “I&nbsp;did not think you used bran for
manure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, Deacon,” said I, “but I use it for food <i>first</i>, and
this is precisely what I would urge you and all others to do.
I&nbsp;feel sure that our dairymen can well afford to buy more
mill-feed, corn-meal, oil-cake, etc., and mix it with their
cow-dung&mdash;or rather, let the cows do the mixing.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">LETTER FROM THE HON. HARRIS LEWIS.</h6>

<p>I wrote to the Hon. Harris Lewis, the well-known dairyman of Herkimer
Co., N.Y., asking him some questions in regard to making and managing
manure on dairy farms. The questions will be understood from the
answers. He writes as follows:</p>

<p>“My Friend Harris.&mdash;This being the first leisure time I have had
since the receipt of your last letter, I&nbsp;devote it to answering
your questions:</p>

<p>“1st. I have no manure cellar.</p>

<p>“I bed my cows with dry basswood sawdust, saving all the liquid
manure, keeping the cows clean, and the stable odors down to a tolerable
degree. This bedding breaks up the tenacity of the cow-manure, rendering
it as easy to pulverize and manage as clear horse-manure. I&nbsp;would
say it is just lovely to bed cows with dry basswood sawdust. This
manure, if left in a large pile, will ferment and burn like horse-manure
in about 10 days. Hence I draw it out as made where I desire to use it,
leaving it in small heaps, convenient to spread.</p>

<p>“My pigs and calves are bedded with straw, and this is piled and
rotted before using.</p>

<p>“I use most of my manure on grass land, and mangels, some on corn and
potatoes; but it pays me best, when in proper condition, to apply all I
do not need for mangels, on meadow and pasture.</p>

<p>“Forty loads, or about 18 to 20 cords is a homœopathic dose for an
acre, and this quantity, or more, applied once in three years to grass
land, agrees with it first rate.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">104</span>
<a name = "page104" id = "page104"> </a>
“The land where I grow mangels gets about this dose every year.</p>

<p>“I would say that my up-land meadows have been mown twice each year
for a great many years.</p>

<p>“I have been using refuse salt from Syracuse, on my mangels, at the
rate of about six bushels per acre, applied broadcast in two
applications. My hen-manure is pulverized, and sifted through a common
coal sieve. The fine I use for dusting the mangels after they have been
singled out, and the lumps, if any, are used to warm up the red
peppers.</p>

<p>“I have sometimes mixed my hen-manure with dry muck, in the
proportion of one bushel of hen-manure to 10 of muck, and received a
profit from it too big to tell of, on corn, and on mangels.</p>

<p>“I have sprinkled the refuse salt on my cow-stable floors sometimes,
but where all the liquid is saved, I&nbsp;think we have salt enough for
most crops.</p>

<p>“I have abandoned the use of plaster on my pastures for the reason
that milk produced on green-clover is not so good as that produced on
the grasses proper. I&nbsp;use all the wood ashes I can get, on my
mangels as a duster, and consider their value greater than the burners
do who sell them to me for 15 cts. a&nbsp;bushel. I&nbsp;have never used
much lime, and have not received the expected benefits from its use so
far. But wood ashes agree with my land as well as manure does. The last
question you ask, but one, is this: ‘What is the usual plan of managing
manure in the dairy districts?’ The usual method is to cut holes in the
sides of the stable, about every ten feet along the whole length of the
barn behind the cows, and pitch the manure out through these holes,
under the eaves of the barn, where it remains until too much in the way,
when it is drawn out and commonly applied to grass land in lumps as big
as your head. This practice is getting out of fashion a little now, but
nearly one-half of all the cow-manure made in Herkimer Co. is lost,
wasted.</p>

<p>“Your last question, ‘What improvement would you suggest,’ I answer
by saying it is of no use to make any to these men, it would be wasted
like their manure.</p>

<p>“The market value of manure in this county is 50 cts. per big load,
or about one dollar per cord.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“That is a capital letter,” said the Deacon. “It is right to the
point, and no nonsense about it.”</p>

<p>“He must make a good deal of manure,” said the Doctor, “to be able to
use 40 loads to the acre on his meadows and
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
pastures once in three years, and the same quantity every year on his
field of mangel-wurzel.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I have been contending for,” I replied; “the
dairymen <i>can</i> make large quantities of manure if they make an
effort to do it, and their farms ought to be constantly improving. Two
crops of hay on the same meadow, each year, will enable a farmer to keep
a large herd of cows, and make a great quantity of manure&mdash;and when
you have once got the manure, there is no difficulty in keeping up and
increasing the productiveness of the land.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">HOW TO MAKE MORE AND BETTER MANURE ON DAIRY
FARMS.</h6>

<p>“You are right,” said the Doctor, “in saying that there is no
difficulty in keeping up and increasing the productiveness of our dairy
farms, when you have once got plenty of manure&mdash;but the difficulty
is to get a good supply of manure to start with.”</p>

<p>This is true, and it is comparatively slow work to bring up a farm,
unless you have plenty of capital and can buy all the artificial manure
you want. By the free use of artificial manures, you could make a farm
very productive in one or two years. But the slower and cheaper method
will be the one adopted by most of our young and intelligent dairymen.
Few of us are born with silver spoons in our mouths. We have to earn our
money before we can spend it, and we are none the worse for the
discipline.</p>

<p>Suppose a young man has a farm of 100 acres, devoted principally to
dairying. Some of the land lies on a creek or river, while other
portions are higher and drier. In the spring of the year, a&nbsp;stream
of water runs through a part of the farm from the adjoining hills down
to the creek or river. The farm now supports ten head of cows, three
horses, half a dozen sheep, and a few pigs. The land is worth $75 per
acre, but does not pay the interest on half that sum. It is getting
worse instead of better. Weeds are multiplying, and the more valuable
grasses are dying out. What is to be done?</p>

<p>In the first place, let it be distinctly understood that the land is
<i>not</i> exhausted. As I have before said, the productiveness of a
farm does not depend so much on the absolute amount of plant-food which
the soil contains, as on the amount of plant-food which is immediately
available for the use of the plants. An acre of land that produces half
a ton of hay, may contain as much plant-food as an acre that produces
three tons of hay. In the one case the plant-food is locked up in such a
form that the crops cannot absorb it, while in the other it is in an
available condition. I&nbsp;have no doubt there are fields on the farm I
am alluding to, that contain
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106" id = "page106"> </a>
3,000 lbs. of nitrogen, and an equal amount of phosphoric acid, per
acre, in the first six inches of the surface soil. This is as much
nitrogen as is contained in 100 tons of meadow-hay, and more phosphoric
acid than is contained in 350 tons of meadow-hay. These are the two
ingredients on which the fertility of our farms mainly depend. And yet
there are soils containing this quantity of plant-food that do not
produce more than half a ton of hay per acre.</p>

<p>In some fields, or parts of fields, the land is wet and the plants
cannot take up the food, even while an abundance of it is within reach.
The remedy in this case is under-draining. On other fields, the
plant-food is locked up in insoluble combinations. In this case we must
plow up the soil, pulverize it, and expose it to the oxygen of the
atmosphere. We must treat the soil as my mother used to tell me to treat
my coffee, when I complained that it was not sweet enough. “I&nbsp;put
plenty of sugar in,” she said, “and if you will stir it up, the coffee
will be sweeter.” The sugar lay undissolved at the bottom of the cup;
and so it is with many of our soils. There is plenty of plant-food in
them, but it needs stirring up. They contain, it may be, 3,000 lbs. of
nitrogen, and other plant-food in still greater proportion, and we are
only getting a crop that contains 18 lbs. of nitrogen a year, and of
this probably the rain supplies 9 lbs. Let us stir up the soil and see
if we cannot set 100 lbs. of this 3,000 lbs. of nitrogen free, and get
three tons of hay per acre instead of half a ton. There are men who own
a large amount of valuable property in vacant city lots, who do not get
enough from them to pay their taxes. If they would sell half of them,
and put buildings on the other half, they might soon have a handsome
income. And so it is with many farmers. They have the elements of 100
tons of hay lying <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘dorment’">dormant</ins> in every acre of their land, while they are
content to receive half a ton a year. They have property enough, but it
is unproductive, while they pay high taxes for the privilege of holding
it, and high wages for the pleasure of boarding two or three hired
men.</p>

<p>We have, say, 3,000 lbs. of nitrogen locked up in each acre of our
soil, and we get 8 or 10 lbs. every year in rain and dew, and yet,
practically, all that we want, to make our farms highly productive, is
100 lbs. of nitrogen per acre per annum. And furthermore, it should be
remembered, that to keep our farms rich, after we have once got them
rich, it is not necessary to develope this amount of nitrogen from the
soil every year. In the case of clover-hay, the entire loss of nitrogen
in the animal and in the milk would not exceed 15 per cent, so that,
when we feed out
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
100 lbs. of nitrogen, we have 85 lbs. left in the manure. We want to
develope 100 lbs. of nitrogen in the soil, to enable us to raise a good
crop to start with, and when this is once done, an annual development of
15 lbs. per acre in addition to the manure, would keep up the
productiveness of the soil. Is it not worth while, therefore, to make an
earnest effort to get started?&mdash;to get 100 lbs. of nitrogen in the
most available condition in the soil?</p>

<p>As I said before, this is practically all that is needed to give us
large crops. This amount of nitrogen represents about twelve tons of
average barn-yard manure&mdash;that is to say, twelve tons contains 100
lbs. of nitrogen. But in point of fact it is not in an immediately
available condition. It would probably take at least two years before
all the nitrogen it contains would be given up to the plants. We want,
therefore, in order to give us a good start, 24 tons of barn-yard manure
on every acre of land. How to get this is the great problem which our
young dairy farmer has to solve. In the grain-growing districts we get
it in part by summer-fallowing, and I believe the dairyman might often
do the same thing with advantage. A&nbsp;thorough summer-fallow would
not only clean the land, but would render some of the latent plant-food
available. This will be organized in the next crop, and when the
dairyman has once got the plant-food, he has decidedly the advantage
over the grain-growing farmer in his ability to retain it. He need not
lose over 16 per cent a year of nitrogen, and not one per cent <i>of the
other elements of plant-food</i>.</p>

<p>The land lying on the borders of the creek could be greatly benefited
by cutting surface ditches to let off the water; and later, probably it
will be found that a few underdrains can be put in to advantage. These
alluvial soils on the borders of creeks and rivers are grand sources of
nitrogen and other plant-food. I&nbsp;do not know the fact, but it is
quite probable that the meadows which Harris Lewis mows twice a year,
are on the banks of the river, and are perhaps flooded in the spring.
But, be this as it may, there is a field on the farm I am alluding to,
lying on the creek, which now produces a bountiful growth of weeds,
rushes, and coarse grasses, which I am sure could easily be made to
produce great crops of hay. The creek overflows in the spring, and the
water lies on some of the lower parts of the field until it is
evaporated. A&nbsp;few ditches would allow all the water to pass off,
and this alone would be a great improvement. If the field was flooded in
May or June, and thoroughly cultivated and harrowed, the sod would be
sufficiently rotted to plow again in August. Then a thorough harrowing,
rolling, and cultivating, would make it as mellow as a garden,
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
and it could be seeded down with timothy and other good grasses the last
of August, or beginning of September, and produce a good crop of hay the
next year. Or, if thought better, it might be sown to rye and seeded
down with it. In either case the land would be greatly improved, and
would be a productive meadow or pasture for years to come&mdash;or until
our young dairyman could afford to give it one of Harris Lewis’
“homœopathic” doses of 40 loads of good manure per acre. He would then
be able to cut two crops of hay a year&mdash;and such hay! But we are
anticipating.</p>

<p>That stream which runs through the farm in the spring, and then dries
up, could be made to irrigate several acres of the land adjoining. This
would double, or treble, or quadruple, (“hold on,” said the Deacon,) the
crops of grass as far as the water reached. The Deacon does not seem to
credit this statement; but I have seen wonderful effects produced by
such a plan.</p>

<p>What I am endeavoring to show, is, that these and similar means will
give us larger crops of hay and grass, and these in turn will enable us
to keep more cows, and make more manure, and the manure will enable us
to grow larger crops on other portions of the farm.</p>

<p>I am aware that many will object to plowing up old grass land, and I
do not wish to be misunderstood on this point. If a farmer has a meadow
that will produce two or three tons of hay, or support a cow, to the
acre, it would be folly to break it up. It is already doing all, or
nearly all, that can be asked or desired. But suppose you have a piece
of naturally good land that does not produce a ton of hay per acre, or
pasture a cow on three acres, if such land can be plowed without great
difficulty, I&nbsp;would break it up as early in the fall as possible,
and summer-fallow it thoroughly, and seed it down again, heavily, with
grass seeds the next August. If the land does not need draining, it will
not forget this treatment for many years, and it will be the farmer’s
own fault if it ever runs down again.</p>

<p>In this country, where wages are so high, we must raise large crops
per acre, or not raise any. Where land is cheap, it may sometimes pay to
compel a cow to travel over three or four acres to get her food, but we
cannot afford to raise our hay in half ton crops; it costs too much to
harvest them. High wages, high taxes, and high-priced land, necessitate
high farming; and by high farming, I&nbsp;mean growing large crops every
year, and on every portion of the farm; but high wages and <i>low-priced
land</i> do not necessarily demand high farming. If the land is cheap we
can suffer it to lie idle without much loss. But when we <i>raise</i>
crops, whether on high-priced
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<a name = "page109" id = "page109"> </a>
land or on low-priced land, we must raise good crops, or the expense of
cultivating and harvesting them will eat up all the profits. In the
dairy districts, I&nbsp;believe land, in proportion to its quality and
nearness to market, commands a higher price than land in the
grain-growing districts. Hence it follows that high farming should be
the aim of the American dairyman.</p>

<p>I am told that there are farms in the dairy districts of this State
worth from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars per acre, on
which a cow to four acres for the year is considered a good average. At
a meeting of the Little Falls Farmers’ Club, the Hon. Josiah Shull, gave
a statement of the receipts and expenses of his farm of 81½ acres. The
farm cost $130 per acre. He kept twenty cows, and fatted one for beef.
The receipts were as follows:</p>

<p>This statement, it is said, the Club considered a very fair
estimate.</p>

<p>Now, here is a farm costing $10,595, the receipts from which, saying
nothing about interest, are less than the expenses. And if you add two
cents per pound more to the price of the cheese, the profit would still
be only about $50 per year. The trouble is not so much in the low price
of cheese, <i>as in the low product per acre</i>. I&nbsp;know some
grain-growing farmers who have done no better than this for a few years
past.</p>

<p>Mr. Shull places the annual depreciation and interest on stock at
$180, equal to nearly one-seventh of the total receipts of the farm. It
would pay the wages and board of another man for six months.

Can not it be avoided? Good beef is relatively much higher in this State
than good cheese. Some of the dairy authorities tell us that cheese is
the cheapest animal food in the world, while beef is the dearest. Why,
then, should our dairymen confine their attention to the production of
the cheapest of farm products, and neglect almost entirely the
production of the dearest? If beef is high and cheese low, why not raise
more beef? On low-priced land it may be profitable to raise and keep
cows solely for the production of cheese, and when the cows are no
longer profitable for this purpose, to sacrifice them&mdash;to throw
them aside as we do a worn-out machine. And in similar circumstances we
may be able to keep sheep solely for their wool, but on high-priced land
we can not afford to keep sheep merely for their wool. We must adopt a
higher system of farming and feeding, and keep sheep that will give us
wool, lambs, and mutton. In parts of South America, where land costs
nothing, cattle can be kept for their bones, tallow, and hides, but
where food is costly we must make better use of it. A&nbsp;cow is a
machine for converting vegetable food into veal, butter, cheese, and
beef. The first cost of the machine, if a good one, is
considerable&mdash;say $100. This machine has to be kept running night
and day, summer and winter, week days and Sundays. If we were running a
steam-flouring mill that could never be allowed to stop, we should be
careful to lay in a good supply of coal and also have plenty of grain on
hand to grind, so that the mill would never have to run empty. No
sensible man would keep up steam merely to run the mill. He would want
to grind all the time, and as much as possible; and yet coal is a much
cheaper source of power than the hay and corn with which we run our
milk-producing machine. How often is the latter allowed to run empty?
The machine is running night and day&mdash;must run, but is it always
running to advantage? Do we furnish fuel enough to enable it to do full
work, or only little more than enough to run the machinery?</p>

<p>“What has all this to do with making manure on dairy farms?” asked
the Deacon; “you are wandering from the point.”</p>

<p>“I hope not; I am trying to show that good feeding will pay better
than poor feeding&mdash;and better food means better manure.”</p>

<p>I estimate that it takes from 15 to 18 lbs. of ordinary hay per day
to run this cow-machine, which we have been talking about, even when
kept warm and comfortable; and if exposed to cold storms, probably not
less than 20 lbs. of hay a day, or its equivalent, and this merely to
keep the machine running, without doing any work. It requires this to
keep the cow alive, and to prevent
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<a name = "page111" id = "page111"> </a>
her losing flesh. If not supplied with the requisite amount of food for
this purpose, she will take enough fat and flesh from her own body to
make up the deficiency; and if she cannot get it, the machine will
stop&mdash;in other words, the cow will die.</p>

<p>We have, then, a machine that costs say $100; that will last on an
average eight years; that requires careful management; that must have
constant watching, or it will be liable to get out of order, and that
requires, merely to keep it running, say 20 lbs. of hay per day. Now,
what do we get in return? If we furnish only 20 lbs. of hay per day we
get&mdash;<i>nothing</i> except manure. If we furnish 25 lbs. of hay per
day, or its equivalent, we get, say half a pound of cheese per day. If
we furnish 30 lbs. we get one pound of cheese per day, or 365 lbs.
a&nbsp;year. We may not get the one pound of cheese every day in the
year; sometimes the cow, instead of giving milk, is furnishing food for
her embryo calf, or storing up fat and flesh; and this fat and flesh
will be used by and by to produce milk. But it all comes from the food
eaten by the cow; and is equal to one pound of cheese per day for 30
lbs. of hay or its equivalent consumed; 20 lbs. of hay gives us nothing;
25 lbs. of hay gives us half a pound of cheese, or 40 lbs. of cheese
from one ton of hay; 30 lbs. gives us one pound, or 66⅔ lbs. of cheese
from one ton of hay; 35 lbs. gives us 1½ lbs., or 85&nbsp;5/7 lbs. of
cheese to one ton of hay; 40 lbs. gives us 2 lbs. of cheese, or 100 lbs.
of cheese from one ton of hay; 45 lbs. gives us 2⅓ lbs. of cheese, or
111 lbs. of cheese from one ton of hay; 50 lbs. gives us 3 lbs. of
cheese, or 120 lbs. of cheese from one ton of hay.</p>

<p>On this basis, one ton of hay, <i>in excess of the amount required to
keep up the animal heat and sustain the vital functions</i>, gives us
200 lbs. of cheese. The point I wish to illustrate by these figures,
which are of course hypothetical, is, that it is exceedingly desirable
to get animals that will eat, digest, and assimilate a large amount of
food, over and above that required to keep up the heat of the body and
sustain the vital functions. When a cow eats only 25 lbs. of hay a day,
it requires one ton of hay to produce 40 lbs. of cheese. But if we could
induce her to eat, digest, and assimilate 50 lbs. a&nbsp;day, one ton
would produce 120 lbs. of cheese. If a cow eats 33 lbs. of hay per day,
or its equivalent in grass, it will require four acres of land, with a
productive capacity equal to 1½ tons of hay per acre, to keep her a
year. Such a cow, according to the figures given above, will produce
401½ lbs. of cheese a year, or its equivalent in growth. A&nbsp;farm of
80 acres, on this basis, would support 20 cows, yielding,
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<a name = "page112" id = "page112"> </a>
say 8,000 lbs. of cheese. Increase the productive power of the farm one
half, (I&nbsp;hope the Deacon has not gone to sleep), and keep 20 cows
that will eat half as much again food, and we should then get 21,600
lbs. of cheese. If cheese is worth 15 cents per lb., a&nbsp;farm of 80
acres, producing 1½ tons of hay, or its equivalent, per acre, and
supporting 20 cows, would give us a gross return of $1,204.50. The same
farm so improved as to produce 2¼ tons of hay or its equivalent, per
acre&mdash;fed to 20 cows <i>capable of eating, digesting, and
assimilating it</i>&mdash;would give a gross return of $3,240.</p>

<p>In presenting these figures, I hope you will not think me a
visionary. I&nbsp;do not think it is possible to get a cow to produce 3
lbs. of cheese a day throughout the whole year. But I do think it quite
possible to so breed and feed a cow that she will produce 3 lbs. of
cheese per day, <i>or its equivalent</i> in veal, flesh, or fat. We
frequently have cows that produce 3 lbs. of cheese a day for several
weeks; and a cow <i>can</i> be so fed that she will produce 3 lbs. of
cheese a day without losing weight. And if she can extract this amount
of matter out of the food for a part of the year, why can not she do so
for the whole year? Are the powers of digestion weaker in the fall and
winter than in spring and summer? If not, we unquestionably sustain
great loss by allowing this digestive power to run to waste. This
digestive power costs us 20 lbs. of hay a day. We can ill afford to let
it lie dormant. But the Deacon will tell me that the cows are allowed
all the food they will eat, winter and summer. Then we must, if they
have digestive power to spare, endeavor to <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘persaude’">persuade</ins> them to eat more. If they
eat as much hay or grass as their stomachs are capable of holding, we
must endeavor to give them richer hay or grass. Not one farmer in a
thousand seems to appreciate the advantage of having hay or grass
containing a high percentage of nutriment. I&nbsp;have endeavored to
show that a cow eating six tons of hay, or its equivalent, in a year,
would produce 400 lbs. of cheese, worth $60. While a cow capable of
eating, digesting, and turning to good account, nine tons of hay, or its
equivalent, would produce 1,090 lbs. of cheese, or its equivalent in
other products, worth $162.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to interrupt the gentleman,” said the Deacon with mock
gravity.</p>

<p>“Then pray don’t,” said I; “I will not detain you long, and the
subject is one which ought to interest you and every other farmer who
keeps his cows on poor grass in summer, and corn-stalks and straw in
winter.”</p>

<p>I was going to say, when the Deacon interrupted me, that the
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
stomach of a cow may not allow her to eat nine tons of hay a year, but
it will allow her to eat six tons; and if these six tons contain as much
nutriment as the nine tons, what is the real difference in its value?
Ordinarily we should probably estimate the one at $10 per ton, and the
other at $15. But according to the above figures, one is worth $10 per
ton and the other $27. To get rich grass, therefore, should be the aim
of the American dairyman. I&nbsp;hope the Deacon begins to see what
connection this has with a large pile of rich manure.</p>

<p>I do not mean merely a heavy growth of grass, but grass containing a
high percentage of nutriment. Our long winters and heavy snows are a
great advantage to us in this respect. Our grass in the spring, after
its long rest, ought to start up like asparagus, and, under the
organizing influence of our clear skies, and powerful sun, ought to be
exceedingly nutritious. Comparatively few farmers, however, live up to
their privileges in this respect. Our climate is better than our
farming, the sun richer than our neglected soil. England may be able to
produce more grass per acre in a year than we can, but we ought to
produce richer grass, and, consequently, more cheese to a cow. And I
believe, in fact, that such is often the case. The English dairyman has
the advantage of a longer season of growth. We have a shorter season but
a brighter sun, and if we do not have richer grass it is due to the want
of draining, clean culture, and manuring. The object of American
dairymen should be, not only to obtain more grass per acre, but to
increase its nutriment in a given bulk. If we could increase it
one-half, making six tons equal to nine tons, we have shown that it is
nearly three times as valuable. Whether this can be done, I&nbsp;have
not now time to consider; but at any rate if your land produces as many
weeds as do some fields on my farm, not to say the Deacon’s, and if the
plant-food that these weeds absorb, could be organized by nutritious
grasses, this alone would do a good deal towards accomplishing the
object. Whether this can be done or not, we want cows that can eat and
turn to good account as much food per annum as is contained in nine tons
of ordinary meadow-hay; and we want this nutriment in a bulk not
exceeding six tons of hay. <i>If possible</i>, we should get this amount
of nutriment in grass or hay. But if we can not do this, we must <i>feed
enough concentrated food</i> to bring it up to the desired standard.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“But will it pay?” asked the Deacon; “I&nbsp;have not much faith in
buying feed. A&nbsp;farmer ought to raise everything he feeds out.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
“As a rule, this may be true,” I replied, “but there are many
exceptions. I&nbsp;am trying to show that it will often pay a dairyman
well to buy feed rich in nitrogen and phosphates, so as to make rich
manure, and give him a start. After he gets his land rich, there is
little difficulty in keeping up its productiveness.</p>

<p>“Now, I have said&mdash;and the figures, if anything, are too
low&mdash;that if a cow, eating six tons of hay, or its equivalent,
a&nbsp;year, produces 400 lbs. of cheese, a&nbsp;cow capable of eating,
digesting, and turning to good account nine tons of hay, or its
equivalent, a&nbsp;year, would produce 1,090 lbs. of cheese, or its
equivalent in other products.”</p>

<p>I would like to say much more on this subject, but I hope enough has
been said to show that there is great advantage in feeding rich food,
even so far as the production of milk or beef is concerned; and if this
is the case, then there is no difficulty in making rich manure on a
dairy farm.</p>

<p>And I am delighted to know that many farmers in the dairy districts
are purchasing more and more bran and meal every year. Taking milk, and
beef, and manure all into the account, I&nbsp;feel sure that it will be
found highly profitable; but you must have good cows&mdash;cows that can
turn their extra food to good account.</p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the merits of the different breeds
of cows. All I wish to show is, that to make better manure, we must use
richer food; and to feed this to advantage, we must have animals that
can turn a large amount of food, over and above the amount required to
sustain the vital functions, into milk, flesh, etc.</p>

<p>“You do not think,” said the Deacon, “that a well-bred cow makes any
richer manure than a common cow?”</p>

<p>Of course not; but to make rich manure, we must feed well; and we can
not afford to feed well unless we have good animals.</p>


<h6 class = "section">HOW TO SAVE AND APPLY MANURE ON A DAIRY-FARM.</h6>

<p>We can not go into details on this subject. The truth is, there are
several good methods of saving manure, and which is best depends
entirely on circumstances. The real point is to save the urine, and keep
the cow-stable clean and sweet. There are three prominent methods
adopted:</p>

<p>1st. To throw all the liquid and solid excrements into a
manure-cellar underneath the cow-stable. In this cellar, dry swamp-muck,
dry earth, or other absorbent material, is mixed with the manure in
sufficient quantity to keep down offensive odors. A&nbsp;little dry
earth or muck is also used in the stable, scattering it twice a day in
the gutters and under the hind legs of the cows. Where this is carried
out, it has many and decided advantages.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<a name = "page115" id = "page115"> </a>
2d. To wheel or throw out the solid parts of the manure, and to have a
drain for carrying the liquid into a tank, where it can be pumped on to
the heap of manure in the yard. Where many horses or sheep are kept, and
only a few cows, this plan can often be used to advantage, as the heap
of manure in the yard, consisting of horse-manure, sheep-manure, and a
small portion of cow-dung, will be able to absorb all the urine of the
cows.</p>

<p>3d. To use sufficient bedding to absorb all the urine in the stable.
In my own case, as I have said before, we usually chaff all our straw
and stalks. The orts are used for bedding, and we also use a little dry
earth&mdash;or, to be more exact, I&nbsp;use it when I attend to the
matter myself, but have always found more or less trouble in getting the
work done properly, unless I give it personal attention. To use “dirt”
to keep the stable clean, is not a popular plan in this neighborhood.
Where there is an abundance of straw, and especially if cut into chaff,
the easiest way to keep the stable clean, and the cows comfortable, is
to use enough of this chaffed straw to absorb all the liquid. Clean out
the stable twice a day, and wheel the manure directly to the heap, and
spread it.</p>

<p>In regard to the application of manure on a dairy-farm, we have seen
what Harris Lewis does with his. I&nbsp;also wrote to T.&nbsp;L.
Harison, Esq., of St. Lawrence Co., N.Y.; and knowing that he is not
only a very intelligent farmer and breeder, but also one of our best
agricultural writers, I&nbsp;asked him if he had written anything on the
subject of manures.</p>

<p>“St. Lawrence Co.,” said the Deacon, “produces capital grass, oats,
and barley, but is, I&nbsp;should think, too far north for winter wheat;
but what did Mr Harison say?”&mdash;Here is his letter:</p>

<p>“I never wrote anything about manure. Catch me at it! Nor do I know
anything about the management of barn-yard manure worth telling. My own
practice is dictated quite as much by convenience as by considerations
of economy.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said the Deacon; “he writes like a sensible man.”</p>

<p>“My rotation,” he continues, “is such that the bulk of the manure
made is applied to <i>one crop</i>; that is, to my hoed crops, corn,
potatoes, and roots, in the second year.</p>

<p>“The manure from the stables is thrown or wheeled out under the sheds
adjoining, and as fast as it becomes so large a quantity as to be in the
way, or whenever there is an opportunity, it is hauled out to the field,
where it is to be used, and put in large piles. It is turned once, if
possible, in the spring, and then spread.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
“The quantity applied, is, as near as may be, 25 loads per acre; but as
we use a great deal of straw, we haul out 30 loads, and estimate that in
the spring it will be about 25 loads.</p>

<p>“If we have any more (and occasionally we have 100 loads over), we
pile it near the barn, and turn it once or twice during the summer, and
use it as seems most profitable&mdash;sometimes to top-dress an old
grass-field, that for some reason we prefer not to break for another
year. Sometimes it goes on a piece of fall wheat, and sometimes is kept
over for a barley field the following spring, and harrowed in just
before sowing.</p>

<p>“I should spread the manure as it comes from the sheds, instead of
piling it, but the great quantity of snow we usually have, has always
seemed to be an insuperable obstacle. It is an advantage to pile it, and
to give it one turning, but, on the other hand, the piles made in cold
weather freeze through, and they take a provokingly long time to thaw
out in the spring. I&nbsp;never found manure <i>piled</i> out of doors
to get too much water from rain.</p>

<p>“I have given up using gypsum, except a little in the stables,
because the clover grows too strong without it, and so long as this is
the case, I&nbsp;do not need gypsum. But I sometimes have a piece of
oats or barley that stands still, and looks sick, and a dose of gypsum
helps it very much.”</p>

<p>“That is a fact worth remembering,” said the Deacon.</p>

<p>“I use some superphosphate,” continues Mr. Harison, “and some ground
bones on my turnips. We also use superphosphate on oats, barley, and
wheat (about 200 lbs. per acre), and find it pays. Last year, our
estimate was, on 10 acres of oats, comparing with a strip in the middle,
left for the purpose, that the 200 lbs. of superphosphate increased the
crop 15 bushels per acre, and gave a gain in quality. It was the
“Manhattan,” which has about three per cent ammonia, and seven to eight
per cent soluble phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>“My rotation, which I stick to as close as I can, is: 1, oats; 2,
corn, and potatoes, and roots; 3, barley or spring wheat; 4, 5, and 6,
grass (clover or timothy, with a little mixture occasionally).</p>

<p>“I am trying to get to 4, fall wheat, but it is mighty risky.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“That is a very sensible letter,” said the Deacon; “but it is evident
that he raises more grain than I supposed was generally the case in the
dairy districts; and the fact that his clover is so heavy that he does
not need plaster, indicates that his land is rich.”</p>

<p>It merely confirms what I have said all along, and that is, that the
dairymen, if they will feed their animals liberally, and cultivate
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
their soil thoroughly, can soon have productive farms. There are very
few of us in this section who can make manure enough to give all our
corn, potatoes, and roots, 25 loads of rotted manure per acre, and have
some to spare.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1877, Mr. Harison wrote: “I&nbsp;have been hauling
out manure all winter as fast as made, and putting it on the land. At
first we spread it; but when deep snows came, we put it in small heaps.
The field looks as if there had been a grain crop on it left uncut.”</p>

<p>“That last remark,” said the Doctor, “indicates that the manure looks
more like straw than well-rotted dung, and is an argument in favor of
your plan of piling the manure in the yard or field, instead of
spreading it on the land, or putting it in small heaps.”</p>

CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h4>

<h5>MANAGEMENT OF MANURES ON GRAIN-FARMS.</h5>

<p>“I am surprised to find,” said the Deacon, “that Mr. Harison, living
as he does in the great grass and dairy district of this State, should
raise so much grain. He has nearly as large a proportion of his land
under the plow as some of the best wheat-growers of Western New
York.”</p>

<p>This remark of the Deacon is right to the point. The truth is, that
some of our best wheat-growers are plowing less land, and are raising
more grass, and keeping more stock; and some of the dairymen, though not
keeping less stock, are plowing more land. The better farmers of both
sections are approaching each other.</p>

<p>At all events, it is certain that the wheat growers will keep more
stock. I&nbsp;wrote to the Hon. Geo. Geddes, of Onondaga Co., N.Y., well
known as a large wheat-grower, and as a life-long advocate of keeping up
the fertility of our farms by growing clover. He replies as follows:</p>

<p>“I regret that I have not time to give your letter the consideration
it deserves. The subject you have undertaken is truly a difficult one.
The circumstances of a grain-raiser and a dairyman are so unlike, that
their views in regard to the treatment of the manure produced on the
farm would vary as greatly as the lines of farming they follow.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
“The grain-grower has straw in excess; he tries hard to get it into such
form that he can draw it to his fields, and get it at work, at the least
cost in labor. So he covers his barn-yards deep with straw, after each
snow-storm, and gets his cattle, sheep, and horses, to trample it under
foot; and he makes his pigs convert all he can into such form that it
will do to apply it to his pastures, etc., in winter or early
spring.</p>

<p>“A load of such manure is large, perhaps, but of no very great value,
as compared with well-rotted stable-manure from grain-fed horses; but it
is as good as much that I have seen drawn from city stables, and carried
far, to restore the worn-out hay-fields on the shores of the North
River&mdash;in fact, quite like it.</p>

<p>“The dairyman, generally, has but little straw, and his manure is
mostly dung of cows, worth much more, per cord, than the straw-litter of
the grain-growers.</p>

<p>“The grain-grower will want no sheds for keeping off the rain, but,
rather, he will desire more water than will fall on an open yard. The
milkman will wish to protect his cow-dung from all rains, or even snows;
so he is a great advocate of manure-sheds. These two classes of farmers
will adopt quite unlike methods of applying their manure to crops.</p>

<p>“I have cited these two classes of farmers, simply to show the
difficulty of making any universal laws in regard to the treatment and
use of barn-yard manure.<span class = "pad1"> ***</span></p>

<p>“I think you and I are fully agreed in regard to the farm being the
true source of the manure that is to make the land grow better with use,
and still produce crops&mdash;perhaps you will go with me so far as to
say, the greater the crops, the more manure they will make&mdash;and the
more manure, the larger the crops.</p>

<p>“Now, I object to any special farming, when applied to a whole great
division of country, such as merely raising grain, or devoted entirely
to dairying.</p>

<p>“I saw at Rome, N.Y., these two leading branches of New York farming
united on the Huntington tract of 1,300 acres. Three or four farms
(I&nbsp;forget which) had separate and distinct management, conducted by
different families, but each had a dairy combined with the raising of
large crops of grain, such as wheat, corn, oats, etc. These grain-crops,
with suitable areas of meadow and pasture, sustained the dairy, and the
cows converted much of the grain, and all of the forage, into manure.
Thus was combined, to mutual advantage, these two important branches of
New York farming. Wheat and cheese to sell, and constant improvement in
crops.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119" id = "page119"> </a>
“In our own case, sheep have been combined with grain-raising. So we
have sold wool, wheat, and barley, and, in all my life, not five tons of
hay. Clover, you know, has been our great forage-crop. We have wintered
our sheep mostly on clover-hay, having some timothy mixed with it, that
was necessarily cut (to make into hay with the medium, or early clover,)
when it was but grass. We have fed such hay to our cows and horses, and
have usually worked into manure the corn-stalks of about 20 acres of
good corn, each winter, and we have worked all the straw into shape to
apply as manure that we could, spreading it thickly on pastures and such
other fields as were convenient. Some straw we have sold, mostly to
paper-makers.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“That,” said the Deacon, “is good, old-fashioned farming. Plenty of
straw for bedding, and good clover and timothy-hay for feed, with wool,
wheat, and barley to sell. No talk about oil-cake, malt-combs, and
mangels; nothing about superphosphate, guano, or swamp-muck.”</p>

<p>Mr. Geddes and Mr. Johnston are both representative farmers; both are
large wheat-growers; both keep their land clean and thoroughly
cultivated; both use gypsum freely; both raise large crops of clover and
timothy; both keep sheep, and yet they represent two entirely different
systems of farming. One is the great advocate of clover; the other is
the great advocate of manure.</p>

<p>I once wrote to Mr. Geddes, asking his opinion as to the best time to
plow under clover for wheat. He replied as follows:</p>

<p>“Plow under the clover when it is at full growth. But your question
can much better be answered at the end of a long, free talk, which can
best be had here. I&nbsp;have many times asked you to come here, not to
see fine farming, for we have none to show, but to see land that has
been used to test the effects of clover for nearly 70 years. On the
ground, I&nbsp;could talk to a willing auditor long, if not wisely.
I&nbsp;am getting tired of being misunderstood, and of having my
statements doubted when I talk about clover as the great renovator of
land. You preach agricultural truth, and the facts you would gather in
this neighborhood are worth your knowing, and worth giving to the world.
So come here and gather some facts about clover. All that I shall try to
prove to you is, that the fact that clover and plaster are by far the
cheapest manures that can be had for our lands, has been demonstrated by
many farmers beyond a doubt&mdash;so much cheaper than barn-yard manure
that the mere loading of and spreading costs more than
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120" id = "page120"> </a>
the plaster and clover. Do not quote me as saying this, but come and see
the farms hereabouts, and talk with our farmers.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Of course I went, and had a capital time. Mr. Geddes has a
magnificent farm of about 400 acres, some four miles from Syracuse. It
is in high condition, and is continually improving, and this is due to
growing large and frequent crops of clover, and <i>to good, deep
plowing, and clean and thorough culture</i>.</p>

<p>We drove round among the farmers. “Here is a man,” said Mr. G., “who
run in debt $45 per acre for his farm. He has educated his family, paid
off his debt, and reports his net profits at from $2,000 to $2,500 a
year on a farm of 90 acres; and this is due to clover. You see he is
building a new barn, and that does not look as though his land was
running down under the system.” The next farmer we came to was also
putting up a new barn, and another farmer was enlarging an old one.
“Now, these farmers have never paid a dollar for manure of any kind
except plaster, and their lands certainly do not deteriorate.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>From Syracuse, I went to Geneva, to see our old friend John Johnston.
“Why did you not tell me you were coming?” he said. “I&nbsp;would have
met you at the cars. But I am right glad to see you. I&nbsp;want to show
you my wheat, where I put on 250 lbs. of guano per acre last fall.
People here don’t know that I used it, and you must not mention it. It
is grand.”</p>

<p>I do not know that I ever saw a finer piece of wheat. It was the
Diehl variety, sown 14th September, at the rate of 1¼ bushels per acre.
It was quite thick enough. One breadth of the drill was sown at the rate
of two bushels per acre. This is earlier. “But,” said Mr.&nbsp;J., “the
other will have larger heads, and will yield more.” After examining the
wheat, we went to look at the piles of muck and manure in the barn-yard,
and from these to a splendid crop of timothy. “It will go 2½ tons of hay
per acre,” said Mr.&nbsp;J., “and now look at this adjoining field. It
is just as good land naturally, and there is merely a fence between, and
yet the grass and clover are so poor as hardly to be worth cutting.”</p>

<p>“What makes the difference?” I asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnston, emphatically, “Manure.”</p>

<p>The poor field did not belong to him!</p>

<p>Mr. Johnston’s farm was originally a cold, wet, clayey soil. Mr.
Geddes’ land did not need draining, or very little. Of course, land that
needs draining, is richer after it is drained, than land that is
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121" id = "page121"> </a>
naturally drained. And though Mr. Johnston was always a good farmer, yet
he says he “never made money until he commenced to drain.” The
accumulated fertility in the land could then be made available by good
tillage, and from that day to this, his land has been growing richer and
richer. And, in fact, the same is true of Mr. Geddes’ farm. It is richer
land to-day than when first plowed, while there is one field that for
seventy years has had no manure applied to it, except plaster. How is
this to be explained? Mr. Geddes would say it was due to clover and
plaster. But this does not fully satisfy those who claim, (and truly),
that “always taking out of the meal-tub and never putting in, soon comes
to the bottom.” The clover can add nothing to the land, that it did not
get from the soil, except organic matter obtained from the atmosphere,
and the plaster furnishes little or nothing except lime and sulphuric
acid. There are all the other ingredients of plant-food to be accounted
for&mdash;phosphoric acid, potash, soda, magnesia, etc. A&nbsp;crop of
clover, or corn, or wheat, or barley, or oats, will not come to
perfection unless every one of these elements is present in the soil in
an available condition. Mr. Geddes has not furnished a single ounce of
any one of them.</p>

<p>“Where do they come from?”</p>

<p>I answer, <i>from the soil itself</i>. There is probably enough of
these elements in the soil to last ten thousand years; and if we return
to the soil all the straw, chaff, and bran, and sell nothing but fine
flour, meat, butter, etc., there is probably enough to last a million
years, and you and I need not trouble ourselves with speculations as to
what will happen after that time. Nearly all our soils are practically
inexhaustible. But of course these elements are not in an available
condition. If they were, the rains would wash them all into the ocean.
They are rendered available by a kind of fermentation.
A&nbsp;manure-heap packed as hard and solid as a rock would not decay;
but break it up, make it fine, turn it occasionally so as to expose it
to the atmosphere, and with the proper degree of moisture and heat it
will ferment rapidly, and all its elements will soon become available
food for plants. Nothing has been created by the process. It was all
there. We have simply made it <i>available</i>. So it is with the soil.
Break it up, make it fine, turn it occasionally, expose it to the
atmosphere, and the elements it contains become available.</p>

<p>I do not think that Mr. Geddes’ land is any better, naturally, than
yours or mine. We can all raise fair crops by cultivating the land
thoroughly, and by never allowing a weed to grow. On Mr. Lawes’
experimental wheat-field, the plot that has never received
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
a particle of manure, produces <i>every year</i> an average of about 15
bushels per acre. And the whole crop is removed&mdash;grain, straw, and
chaff. Nothing is returned. And that the land is not remarkably rich, is
evident from the fact that some of the farms in the neighborhood,
produce, under the ordinary system of management, but little more wheat,
once in four or five years than is raised <i>every year</i> on this
experimental plot without any manure.</p>

<p>Why? Because these farmers do not half work their land, and the
manure they make is little better than rotten straw. Mr. Lawes’
wheat-field is plowed twice every year, and when I was there, the crop
was hand-hoed two or three times in the spring. Not a weed is suffered
to grow. And this is all there is to it.</p>

<p>Now, of course, instead of raising 15 bushels of wheat every year, it
is a good deal better to raise a crop of 30 bushels every other year,
and still better to raise 45 bushels every third year. And it is here
that clover comes to our aid. It will enable us to do this very thing,
and the land runs no greater risk of exhaustion than Mr. Lawes’
unmanured wheat crop.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Mr. Geddes and I do not differ as much as you suppose. In fact,
I&nbsp;do not believe that we differ at all. He has for years been an
earnest advocate for growing clover as a renovating crop. He thinks it
by far the cheapest manure that can be obtained in this section.
I&nbsp;agree with him most fully in all these particulars. He formed his
opinion from experience and observation. I&nbsp;derived mine from the
Rothamsted experiments. And the more I see of practical farming, the
more am I satisfied of their truth. Clover is, unquestionably, the great
renovating crop of American agriculture. A&nbsp;crop of clover, equal to
two tons of hay, when plowed under, will furnish more ammonia to the
soil than twenty tons of straw-made manure, drawn out fresh and wet in
the spring, or than twelve tons of our ordinary barn-yard manure. No
wonder Mr. Geddes and other intelligent farmers recommend plowing under
clover as manure. I&nbsp;differ from them in no respect except this:
that it is not absolutely essential to plow clover under in the green
state in order to get its fertilizing effect; but, if made into hay, and
this hay is fed to animals, and all the manure carefully saved, and
returned to the land, there need be comparatively little loss. The
animals will seldom take out more than from five to ten per cent of all
the nitrogen furnished in the food&mdash;and less still of mineral
matter. I&nbsp;advocate growing all the clover you possibly can&mdash;so
does Mr. Geddes. He says, plow it under for manure. So say
I&mdash;unless you can make more from feeding out the clover-hay,
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
than will pay you for waiting a year, and for cutting and curing the
clover and drawing back the manure. If you plow it under, you are sure
of it. There is no loss. In feeding it out, you may lose more or less
from leaching, and injurious fermentation. But, of course, you need not
lose anything, except the little that is retained in the flesh, or wool,
or milk, of the animals. As things <i>are</i> on many farms, it is
perhaps best to plow under the clover for manure at once. As things
ought to be, it is a most wasteful practice. If you know how to feed out
the hay to advantage, and take pains to save the manure (and to add to
its value by feeding oil-cake, bran, etc., with it), it is far better to
mow your clover, once for hay, and once for seed, than to plow it under.
Buy oil-cake and bran with the money got from the seed, and growing
clover-seed will not injure the land.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>I am glad to hear that Mr. Geddes occasionally sells straw.
I&nbsp;once sold 15 tons of straw to the paper-makers for $150, they
drawing it themselves, and some of my neighbors criticised me severely
for doing so. It is not considered an orthodox practice. I&nbsp;do not
advocate selling straw as a rule; but, if you have more than you can use
to advantage, and it is bringing a good price, sell part of the straw
and buy bran, oil-cake, etc., with the money. To feed nothing but straw
to stock is poor economy; and to rot it down for manure is no better.
Straw itself is not worth $3.00 a ton for manure; and as one ton of
straw, spread in an open yard to rot, will make, in spring, about four
tons of so-called manure, and if it costs 50 cents a ton to draw out and
spread it, the straw, even at this comparatively high estimate of its
value, nets you, when fed out alone, or rotted down, only $1.00 a
ton.</p>

<p>I had about 30 tons of straw. Fed out alone or rotted down it would
make 120 tons of manure. After deducting the expense of hauling, and
spreading, it nets me on the land, $30. Now sell half the straw for
$150, and buy three tons of oil-cake to feed out with the other half,
and you would have about seventy tons of manure. The manure from the
fifteen tons of straw is worth, say $45, and from the three tons of
oil-cake, $60, or $105. It will cost $35 to draw and spread it, and will
thus net on the land, $70. So far as the manure question is concerned,
therefore, it is far better to sell half your straw, and buy oil-cake
with the money, than to feed it out alone&mdash;and I think it is also
far better for the stock. Of course, it would be better for the farm,
not to sell any of the straw, and to buy six tons of oil-cake to feed
out with it;
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<a name = "page124" id = "page124"> </a>
but those of us who are short of capital, must be content to bring up
our land by slow degrees.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“I am at a loss to understand,” wrote Mr. Geddes, “what you mean,
when you say that a ton of straw will make, in the spring of the year,
four tons of so-called manure. If you had said that four tons of straw
would make one ton of manure, I&nbsp;should have thought nothing of it.
But how you can turn one ton of straw into four tons of anything that
anybody will call manure, I&nbsp;do not see. In a conversation I had
with Hon. Lewis F. Allen, of Black Rock, more than a year ago, he told
me that he had enquired of the man who furnished hay for feeding cattle
at the Central Yards, in Buffalo, as to the loads of manure he sold, and
though I can not now say the exact quantity to a ton of hay,
I&nbsp;remember that it was very little&mdash;far less than I had before
supposed. Please explain this straw-manure matter.”</p>

<p>Boussingault, the great French chemist-farmer, repeatedly analyzed
the manure from his barn-yard. “The animals which had produced this
dung, were 30 horses, 30 oxen, and from 10 to 20 pigs. The absolute
quantity of moisture was ascertained, by first drying in the air a
considerable weight of dung, and after pounding, continuing and
completing, the drying of a given quantity.” No one can doubt the
accuracy of the results. The dung made in the</p>

<p>Fresh solid cow-dung contains, according to the same authority, 90

<p>I have frequently seen manure drawn out in the spring, that had not
been decomposed at all, and with more or less snow among it, and with
water dripping from the wagon, while it was being loaded. It was, in
fact, straw saturated with water, and discolored by the droppings of
animals. Now, how much of such manure would a ton of dry straw make? If
we should take 20 lbs. of straw, trample it down, and from time to time
sprinkle it with water and snow, until we had got on 80 lbs., and then
put on 20 lbs. more straw, and 80 lbs. more water, and keep on until we
had used up a ton of straw, how much “so-called manure,” should we have
to draw out?</p>

<p>In other words, we get five tons of such manure from one ton of
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
straw. This is, perhaps, an extreme case, but there can be little doubt,
that a ton of straw, trampled down by cattle, and sheep, in an open
barn-yard, exposed to snow and rain, would weigh four tons when drawn
out wet in the spring.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Yes, it is quite an argument in favor of manure cellars. I&nbsp;have
always had a prejudice against them&mdash;probably, because the first
one I saw was badly managed. There is, however, no necessity, even in an
ordinary open barn-yard, with more or less sheds and stables, of having
so much water in the manure when drawn out. The real point of my
remarks, which so surprised Mr. Geddes, was this: We have to draw out so
much water with our manure, under any circumstances, that we should try
to have it as rich as possible. It is certainly true, that, <i>if</i>
the manure from a ton of straw is worth $3, that from a ton of
clover-hay, is worth $10. And it costs no more to draw out and spread
the one than the other. I&nbsp;have never yet found a farmer who would
believe that a ton of clover-hay, rotted down in the barn-yard, would
make three or four tons of manure; but he would readily assent to the
proposition, that it took four or five tons of green clover to make a
ton of hay; and that if these four or five tons of green-clover were
rotted in the yard, it would make three or four tons of manure. And yet,
the only difference between the green-clover and the hay, is, that the
latter has lost some 60 or 70 per cent of water in curing. Add that
amount of water to the hay, and it will make as much manure as the
green-clover from which the hay was made.</p>


<h6 class = "section">GYPSUM AND CLOVER AS MANURE.</h6>

<p>A good farmer came in while we were talking. “Nothing like plaster
and clover,” he said, “for keeping up a wheat-farm.” And you will find
this the general opinion of nearly all American wheat-growers. It must
be accepted as a fact. But the deductions drawn from the fact are as
various as they are numerous.</p>

<p>Let us look first at the fact. And, if you like, we will take my own
farm as an example. About 60 years ago, it was covered with the primeval
forest. The trees, on the higher and drier land, were first cut down,
and many of them burnt on the land. Wheat was sown among the stumps. The
crop varied in different years, from 10 to 30 bushels per acre. When 30
bushels were grown, the fact was remembered. When 10 bushels only were
grown, little was said about it in after years, until now there is a
general impression that our wheat crops were formerly much larger per
acre than now. I&nbsp;doubt it; but we will not discuss the point. One
thing is
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
certain, the land would produce good crops of clover; and when this
clover was plowed under for manure, we got better crops of wheat
afterwards. This was the rule. Later, we commenced to use gypsum as a
top-dressing on clover. The effect was often wonderful. Farmers will
tell you that they sowed 200 lbs. of plaster per acre, on their young
clover, in the spring, and it <i>doubled the crop</i>. This statement
expresses an agricultural, and not an arithmetical fact. We do not know
that the crop on the plastered portion was twice as heavy as on the
unplastered. We know that it was larger, and more luxuriant. There was a
greater, and more vigorous growth. And this extra growth was caused by
the small top-dressing of powdered gypsum rock. It was a great fact in
agriculture. I&nbsp;will call it fact, No.&nbsp;1.</p>

<p>Then, when the clover was turned under, we usually got good wheat.
This is fact, No. 2. On these two facts, hang many of our agricultural
theories. We may state these facts in many ways. Still, it all comes to
this: Clover is good for wheat; plaster is good for clover.</p>

<p>There is another fact, which is a matter of general observation and
remark. You rarely find a good farmer who does not pay special attention
to his clover-crop. When I was riding with Mr. Geddes, among the farmers
of Onondaga County, on passing a farm where everything looked
thrifty&mdash;good fences, good buildings, good garden, good stock, and
the land clean and in good condition&mdash;I would ask who lived there,
or some other question. No matter what. The answer was always the same.
“Oh! he is another of our clover men.” We will call this fact,
No.&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>And when, a year afterwards, Mr. Geddes returned my visit, and I
drove him around among the farmers of Monroe County, he found precisely
the same state of facts. All our good farmers were clover men. Among the
good wheat-growers in Michigan, you will find the same state of
things.</p>

<p>These are the facts. Let us not quarrel over them.</p>

CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h4>

<h5>THE CHEAPEST MANURE A FARMER CAN USE.</h5>

<p>I do not know who first said, “The cheapest manure a farmer can use
is&mdash;clover-seed,” but the saying has become part of our
agricultural literature, and deserves a passing remark.</p>

<p>I have heard good farmers in Western New York say, that if they had a
field sown with wheat that they were going to plow the spring after the
crop was harvested, they would sow 10 lbs. of clover-seed on the wheat
in the spring. They thought that the growth of the clover in the fall,
after the wheat was cut, and the growth the next spring, before the land
was plowed, would afford manure worth much more than the cost of the
clover-seed.</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it,” said the Deacon; “but would it not be better to
let the crop grow a few months longer, and then plow it under?”</p>

<p>“But that is not the point,” I remarked; “we sometimes adopt a
rotation when Indian-corn follows a crop of wheat. In such a case, good
farmers sometimes plow the land in the fall, and again the next spring,
and then plant corn. This is one method. But I have known, as I said
before, good farmers to seed down the wheat with clover; and the
following spring, say the third week in May, plow under the young
clover, and plant immediately on the furrow. If the land is warm, and in
good condition, you will frequently get clover, by this time,
a&nbsp;foot high, and will have two or three tons of succulent
vegetation to turn under; and the farmer who first recommended the
practice to me, said that the cut-worms were so fond of this
green-clover that they did not molest the young corn-plants. I&nbsp;once
tried the plan myself, and found it to work well; but since then,
I&nbsp;have kept so many pigs and sheep, that clover has been too useful
to plow under. But we will not discuss this point at present.</p>

<p>“What I wanted to say is this: Here we have a field in wheat. Half of
it (A) we seed down with 12 lbs. of clover-seed per acre; the other half
(B) not. The clover-seed and sowing on A, cost, say, $2 per acre. We
plow B in the fall; this will cost us about as much as the clover seed
sown on A. In the spring, A&nbsp;and B are both plowed and planted to
corn. Now, which half of the field will be in the cleanest and best
condition, and which will produce the best corn, and the best barley, or
oats, afterwards?”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128" id = "page128"> </a>
“I&nbsp;vote for A,” said the Deacon.</p>

<p>“I vote for A,” said the Doctor.</p>

<p>“I vote for A,” said the Squire.</p>

<p>“I should think,” modestly suggested Charley, “that it would depend
somewhat on the soil,” and Charley is right. On a clean, moderately rich
piece of light, sandy soil, I&nbsp;should certainly expect much better
corn, and better barley or oats, on A, where the clover was grown, than
on B. But if the field was a strong loam, that needed thorough
cultivation to get it mellow enough for corn, I&nbsp;am inclined to
think that B would come out ahead. At any rate, I&nbsp;am sure that on
my own farm, moderately stiff land, if I was going to plant corn after
wheat, I&nbsp;should <i>not</i> seed it down with clover. I&nbsp;would
plow the wheat stubble immediately after harvest, and harrow and
cultivate it to kill the weeds, and then, six weeks or two months later,
I&nbsp;would plow it again. I&nbsp;would draw out manure in the winter,
pile it up in the field to ferment, and the next spring spread it, and
plow it under, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>“And then what?” asked the Deacon. &mdash;“Why the truth is,” said I,
“then I would not plant corn at all. I&nbsp;should either sow the field
to barley, or drill in mangel-wurzel or Swede-turnips. But if I
<i>did</i> plant corn, I&nbsp;should expect better corn than if I had
sown clover with the wheat; and the land, if the corn was well
cultivated, would be remarkably clean, and in fine condition; and the
next time the land was seeded down with clover, we could reasonably
expect a great crop.”</p>

<p>The truth is, that clover-seed is sometimes a very cheap manure, and
farmers are in no danger of sowing too much of it. I&nbsp;do not mean
sowing too much seed per acre, but they are in no danger of sowing too
many acres with clover. On this point, there is no difference of
opinion. It is only when we come to explain the action of
clover&mdash;when we draw deductions from the facts of <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘the the’">the</ins> case&mdash;that we
enter a field bristling all over with controversy.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“You have just finished threshing,” said the Deacon, “and for my
part, I&nbsp;would rather hear how your wheat turned out, than to listen
to any of your chemical talk about nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and
potash.”</p>

<p>“The wheat,” said I, “turned out full as well as I expected. Fourteen
acres of it was after wheat, and eight acres of it after oats. Both
these fields were seeded down with clover last year, but the clover
failed, and there was nothing to be done but to risk them again with
wheat. The remainder was after barley. In all,
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129" id = "page129"> </a>
there was not quite 40 acres, and we had 954 bushels of Diehl wheat.
This is not bad in the circumstances; but I shall not be content until I
can average, taking one year with another, 35 to 40 bushels per acre. If
the land had been rich enough, there would unquestionably have been 40
bushels per acre this year. That is to say, the <i>season</i> was quite
capable of producing this amount; and I think the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘mechancial’">mechanical</ins>
condition of the land was also equal to it; all that was needed was
sufficient available plant-food in the soil.”</p>

<p>“I can see no reason,” said the Doctor, “why you may not average 40
bushels of wheat per acre in a good season.”</p>

<p>“The field of 14 acres,” said I, “where wheat followed wheat, yielded
23 bushels per acre. Last year it yielded 22 bushels per acre; and so we
got in the two years 45 bushels per acre.”</p>

<p>This field has had no manure of any kind for years. In fact, since
the land was cleared, 40 or 50 years ago, I&nbsp;presume that all the
manure that has been applied would not, in the aggregate, be equal to
more than a good crop of clover-hay. The available plant-food required
to produce these two crops of wheat came from the soil itself, and from
the rain, dews, and atmosphere. The land is now seeded down with clover,
and with the aid of a bushel or two of plaster per acre, next spring, it
is not improbable that, if mown twice for hay next year, it will yield
in the two crops three tons of hay per acre.</p>

<p>Now, three tons of clover-hay contain about 33 lbs. of phosphoric
acid, 90 lbs. of potash, and 150 lbs. of nitrogen.</p>

<p>The last crop of wheat, of 22 bushels per acre, and say 1,500 lbs. of
straw, would contain:</p>

<p>It seems very unkind in the wheat-plants not to give me more than 22
bushels per acre, when the clover-plants coming after will find
phosphoric acid enough for 40 bushels of wheat, and potash and nitrogen
enough for nearly 100 bushels of wheat per acre. And these are the three
important constituents of plant-food.</p>

<p>Why, then, did I get only 22 bushels of wheat per acre? I got 23
bushels on the same land the year previous, and it is not improbable
that if I had sown the same land to wheat again this fall, I&nbsp;should
get 12 or 15 bushels per acre again next year. But the clover will find
plant-food enough for 40 bushels of wheat.</p>

<p>“There is not much doubt,” said the Deacon, “that you will
<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<a name = "page130" id = "page130"> </a>
get a good crop of clover, if you will keep the sheep off of the land
this fall. But I do not see what you mean by the clover-plants finding
food enough for 40 bushels of wheat, while in point of fact, if you had
sown the field again to wheat this fall, you would not, as you say,
probably get more than 12 or 15 bushels of wheat<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p>“He means this,” said the Doctor. “If he had sown the land to wheat
this fall, without manure, he would probably not get over 15 bushels of
wheat per acre, and yet you both agree that the land will, in all
probability, produce next year, if mown twice, three tons of clover-hay
per acre, without any manure.</p>

<p>“Now, if we admit that the clover gets no more nitrogen from the rain
and dews, and from the atmosphere, than the wheat will get, then it
follows that this soil, which will only produce 15 bushels of wheat per
acre, does, in point of fact, contain plant-food enough for 40 bushels
of wheat, and the usual proportion of straw.</p>

<p>“The two crops take up from the soil as follows:</p>

<p>“These facts and figures,” continued the Doctor, “are worth looking
at and thinking about. Why can not the wheat get as much phosphoric acid
out of the soil as the clover?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said the Deacon, “the roots of the clover go down deeper
into the subsoil than the roots of wheat.”</p>

<p>“That is a very good reason, so far as it goes,” said I, “but does
not include all the facts. I&nbsp;have no sort of doubt, that if I had
sown this land to wheat, and put on 75 lbs. of nitrogen per acre,
I&nbsp;should have got a wheat-crop containing, in grain and straw, 30
lbs. of phosphoric acid. And so the reason I got 15 bushels of wheat per
acre, instead of 40 bushels, is not because the roots of wheat do not go
deep enough to find sufficient soluble phosphoric acid.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said the Doctor, “the nitrogen you apply may render the
phosphoric acid in the soil more soluble.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said I; “and this was the answer Liebig gave to Mr.
Lawes. Of which more at some future time. But this answer, like the
Deacon’s, does not cover all the facts of the case; for a supply of
soluble phosphoric acid would not, in all probability, give me a large
crop of wheat. I&nbsp;will give you some facts presently bearing on this
point.</p>

<p>“What we want to find out is, why the clover can get so much more
phosphoric acid, potash, and nitrogen, than the wheat, from the same
soil?”</p>


<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<a name = "page131" id = "page131"> </a>
<h6 class = "section">MORE ABOUT CLOVER.</h6>

<p>The Deacon seemed to think the Doctor was going to give a scientific
answer to the question. “If the clover <i>can</i> get more nitrogen,
phosphoric acid, and potash, from the same soil than wheat,” said he,
“why not accept the fact, and act accordingly? You scientific gentlemen
want to explain everything, and sometimes make confusion worse
confounded. We know that a sheep will grow fat in a pasture where a cow
would starve.”</p>

<p>“True,” said the Doctor, “and that is because the cow gathers food
with her tongue, and must have the grass long enough for her to get hold
of it; while a sheep picks up the grass with her teeth and gums, and,
consequently, the sheep can eat the grass down into the very
ground.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Deacon; “and how do you know but that the roots
of the clover gather up their food sheep-fashion, while the wheat-roots
eat like a cow?”</p>

<p>“That is not a very scientific way of putting it,” said the Doctor;
“but I am inclined to think the Deacon has the right idea.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, then,” said I, “we had better let it go at that until we
get more light on the subject. We must conclude that the wheat can not
get food enough from the soil to yield a maximum crop, not because there
is not food enough in the field, but the roots of the wheat are so
constituted that they can not gather it up; while clover-roots, foraging
in the same soil, can find all they want.”</p>

<p>“Clover,” said the Deacon, “is the scavenger of the farm; like a pig,
it gathers up what would otherwise be wasted.”</p>

<p>“Of course, these illustrations,” said the Doctor, “do not give us
any clear idea of <i>how</i> the clover-plants take up food. We must
recollect that the roots of plants take up their food in solution; and
it has just occurred to me that, possibly, Mr. Lawes’ experiments on the
amount of water given off by plants during their growth, may throw some
light on the subject we are discussing.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lawes found,” continued the Doctor, “that a wheat-plant, from
March 19 to June 28, or 101 days, evaporated through its leaves, etc.,
45,713 grains of water; while a clover-plant, standing alongside, and in
precisely similar condition, evaporated 55,093 grains. The clover was
cut June 28, when in full bloom. The wheat-plant was allowed to grow
until ripe, Sept. 7. From June 28 to Sept. 7, or 72 days, the
wheat-plant evaporated 67,814 grains.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” said the Deacon; “as I understand, the clover-plant
evaporated more water than the wheat-plant, until the 28th of June, but
that during the next 71 days, the wheat-plant evaporated more water than
it had during the previous 101 days.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132" id = "page132"> </a>
“Yes,” said I, “and if these facts prove nothing else, they at least
show that there is a great difference between wheat and clover.
I&nbsp;was at Rothamsted when these experiments were made. During the
first nine days of the experiment, the clover-plant evaporated 399.6
grains of water; while the wheat-plant, standing alongside, evaporated
only 128.7 grains. In other words, the clover-plant evaporated three
times as much water as the wheat-plant. During the next 31 days, the
wheat-plant evaporated 1,267.8 grains, and the clover-plant 1,643.0
grains; but during the next 27 days, from April 28 to May 25, the
wheat-plant evaporated 162.4 grains of water per day, while the
clover-plant only evaporated 109.2 grains per day. During the next 34
days, from May 25 to June 28, the wheat-plant evaporated 1,177.4 grains
per day, and the clover-plant 1,473.5 grains per day.”</p>

<p>“In June,” said the Deacon, “the clover evaporates ten times as much
water per day as it did in May. How much water would an acre of clover
evaporate?”</p>

<p>“Let Charley figure it out,” said the Doctor. “Suppose each plant
occupies 10 square inches of land; there are 6,272,640 square inches in
an acre, and, consequently, there would be 627,264 clover-plants on an
acre. Each plant evaporated 1,473.5 grains per day, and there are 7,000
grains in a pound.”</p>

<p>Charley made the calculation, and found that an acre of clover, from
May 25 to June 28, evaporated 528,598 lbs. of water, or 15,547 lbs. per
day.</p>

<p>A much more accurate way of ascertaining how much water an acre of
clover evaporates is afforded us by these experiments. After the plants
were cut, they were weighed and analyzed; and it being known exactly how
much water each plant had given off during its growth, we have all the
facts necessary to tell us just how much a crop of a given weight would
evaporate. In brief, it was found that for each pound of dry substance
in the wheat-plant, 247.4 lbs. of water had been evaporated; and for
each pound in the clover-plant, 269.1 lbs.</p>

<p>An acre of wheat of 15 bushels per acre of grain, and an equal weight
of straw, would exhale during the spring and summer 177¾ tons of water,
or calculated on 172 days, the duration of the experiment, 2,055 lbs.
per day.</p>

<p>An acre of clover that would make two tons of hay, would pass off
through its leaves, in 101 days, 430 tons of water, or 8,600 lbs. per
day&mdash;more than four times as much as the wheat.</p>

<p>These figures show that, from an agricultural point of view, there is
a great difference between, wheat and clover; and yet I
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
think the figures do not show the whole of the difference. The clover
was cut just at the time when the wheat-plant was entering on its period
of most rapid growth and exhalation, and, consequently, the figures
given above probably exaggerate the amount of water given off by the
wheat during the early part of the season. It is, at any rate, quite
clear, and this is all I want to show, that an acre of good clover
exhales a much larger amount of water from spring to hay-harvest than an
acre of wheat.</p>

<p>“And what,” said the Deacon, who was evidently getting tired of the
figures, “does all this prove?”</p>

<p>The figures prove that clover can drink a much greater quantity of
water during March, April, May, and June, than wheat; and, consequently,
to get the same amount of food, it is not necessary that the clover
should have as much nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash, etc., in the
water as the wheat-plant requires. I&nbsp;do not know that I make myself
understood<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has close quote">.</ins></p>

<p>“You want to show,” said the Deacon, “that the wheat-plant requires
richer food than clover.”</p>

<p>Yes, I want to show that, though clover requires <i>more</i> food per
day than wheat, yet the clover can drink such a large amount of water,
that it is not necessary to make the “sap of the soil” so rich in
nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, for clover, as it is for wheat.
I&nbsp;think this tells the whole story.</p>

<p>Clover is, or may be, the grandest renovating and enriching crop
commonly grown on our farms. It owes its great value, not to any power
it may or may not possess of getting nitrogen from the atmosphere, or
phosphoric acid and potash from the subsoil, but principally, if not
entirely, to the fact that the roots can drink up such a large amount of
water, and live and thrive on very weak food.</p>


<h6 class = "section">HOW TO MAKE A FARM RICH BY GROWING CLOVER.</h6>

<p>Not by growing the clover, and selling it. Nothing would exhaust the
land so rapidly as such a practice. We must either plow under the
clover, let it rot on the surface, or pasture it, or use it for soiling,
or make it into hay, feed it out to stock, and return the manure to the
land. If clover got its nitrogen from the atmosphere, we might sell the
clover, and depend on the roots left in the ground, to enrich the soil
for the next crop. But if, as I have endeavored to show, clover gets its
nitrogen from a weak solution in the soil, it is clear, that though for
a year or two we might raise good crops from the plant-food left in the
clover-roots, yet we
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134" id = "page134"> </a>
should soon find that growing a crop of clover, and leaving only the
roots in the soil, is no way to permanently enrich land.</p>

<p>I do not say that such a practice will “exhaust” the land.
Fortunately, while it is an easy matter to impoverish land, we should
have to call in the aid of the most advanced agricultural science,
before we could “exhaust” land of its plant-food. The free use of
Nitrate of Soda, or Sulphate of Ammonia, might enable us to do something
in the way of exhausting our farms, but it would reduce our balance at a
bank, or send us to the poor-house, before we had fully robbed the land
of its plant-food.</p>

<p>To exhaust land, by growing and selling clover, is an agricultural
impossibility, for the simple reason that, long before the soil is
exhausted, the clover would produce such a poverty-stricken crop, that
we should give up the attempt.</p>

<p>We can make our land poor, by growing clover, and selling it; or, we
can make our land rich, by growing clover, and feeding it out on the
farm. Or, rather, we can make our land rich, by draining it where
needed, cultivating it thoroughly, so as to develope the latent
plant-food existing in the soil, and then by growing clover to take up
and organize this plant-food. This is how to make land rich by growing
clover. It is not, in one sense, the clover that makes the land rich; it
is the draining and cultivation, that furnishes the food for the clover.
The clover takes up this food and concentrates it. The clover does not
create the plant-food; it merely saves it. It is the thorough
cultivation that enriches the land, not the clover.</p>

<p>“I wish,” writes a distinguished New York gentleman, who has a farm
of barren sand, “you would tell us whether it is best to let clover
ripen and rot on the surface, or plow it under when in blossom? I have
heard that it gave more nitrogen to the land to let it ripen and rot on
it, but as I am no chemist, I&nbsp;do not know.”</p>

<p>If, instead of plowing under the clover&mdash;say the last of June,
it was left to grow a month longer, it is quite possible that the
clover-roots and seed would contain more nitrogen than they did a month
earlier. It was formerly thought that there was a loss of nitrogen
during the ripening process, but the evidence is not altogether
conclusive on the point. Still, if I had a piece of sandy land that I
wished to enrich by clover, I&nbsp;do not think I should plow it under
in June, on the one hand, or let it grow until maturity, and rot down,
on the other. I&nbsp;should rather prefer to mow the crop just as it
commenced to blossom, and let the clover lie, spread out on the land, as
left by the machine. There would, I&nbsp;think, be no loss of
fertilizing elements by evaporation, while the clover-hay would act
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135" id = "page135"> </a>
as a mulch, and the second growth of clover would be encouraged by it.
Mow this second crop again, about the first week in August. Then, unless
it was desirable to continue the process another year, the land might be
plowed up in two or three weeks, turning under the two previous crops of
clover that are on the surface, together with the green-clover still
growing. I&nbsp;believe this would be better than to let the clover
exhaust itself by running to seed.</p>

CHAPTER XXV.</a></h4>

<h5>DR. VŒLCKER’S EXPERIMENTS ON CLOVER.</h5>

<p>In the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, for
1868, Dr. Vœlcker, the able chemist of the Society, and formerly
Professor of Agricultural Chemistry, at the Royal Agricultural College
at Cirencester, England, has given us a paper “On the Causes of the
Benefits of Clover, as a preparatory Crop for Wheat.” The paper has been
repeatedly and extensively quoted in this country, but has not been as
critically studied as the importance of the subject demands.</p>

<p>“Never mind all that,” said the Deacon, “tell us what Dr. Vœlcker
says.”</p>

<p>“Here is the paper,” said I, “and Charley will read it to us.”
Charley read as follows:</p>

<p>“Agricultural chemists inform us, that in order to maintain the
productive powers of the land unimpaired, we must restore to it the
phosphoric acid, potash, nitrogen, and other substances, which enter
into the composition of our farm crops; the constant removal of organic
and inorganic soil constituents, by the crops usually sold off the farm,
leading, as is well known, to more or less rapid deterioration and
gradual exhaustion of the land. Even the best wheat soils of this and
other countries, become more and more impoverished, and sustain a loss
of wheat-yielding power, when corn-crops are grown in too rapid
succession without manure. Hence, the universal practice of manuring,
and that also of consuming oil-cake, corn, and similar purchased food on
land naturally poor, or partially exhausted by previous cropping.</p>

<p>“Whilst, however, it holds good as a general rule, that no soil can
be cropped for any length of time, without gradually becoming
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<a name = "page136" id = "page136"> </a>
more and more infertile, if no manure be applied to it, or if the
fertilizing elements removed by the crops grown thereon, be not by some
means or other restored, it is, nevertheless, a&nbsp;fact, that after a
heavy crop of clover carried off as hay, the land, far from being less
fertile than before, is peculiarly well adapted, even without the
addition of manure, to bear a good crop of wheat in the following year,
provided the season be favorable to its growth. This fact, indeed, is so
well known, that many farmers justly regard the growth of clover as one
of the best preparatory operations which the land can undergo, in order
to its producing an abundant crop of wheat in the following year. It has
further been noticed, that clover mown twice, leaves the land in a
better condition, as regards its wheat-producing capabilities, than when
mown once only for hay, and the second crop fed off on the land by
sheep; for, notwithstanding that in the latter instance the fertilizing
elements in the clover-crop are in part restored in the sheep
excrements, yet, contrary to expectation, this partial restoration of
the elements of fertility to the land has not the effect of producing
more or better wheat in the following year, than is reaped on land from
off which the whole clover-crop has been carried, and to which no manure
whatever has been applied.</p>

<p>“Again, in the opinion of several good, practical agriculturists,
with whom I have conversed on the subject, land whereon clover has been
grown for seed in the preceding year, yields a better crop of wheat than
it does when the clover is mown twice for hay, or even only once, and
afterwards fed off by sheep.”</p>

<p>“I&nbsp;do not think,” said the Deacon, “that this agrees with our
experience here. A&nbsp;good crop of clover-seed is profitable, but it
is thought to be rather hard on land.”</p>

<p>“Such,” said I, “is the opinion of John Johnston. He thinks allowing
clover to go to seed, impoverishes the soil.”</p>

<p>Charley, continued to read:</p>

<p>“Whatever may be the true explanation of the apparent anomalies
connected with the growth and chemical history of the clover-plant, the
facts just mentioned, having been noticed, not once or twice only, or by
a solitary observer, but repeatedly, and by numbers of intelligent
farmers, are certainly entitled to credit; and little wisdom, as it
strikes me, is displayed by calling them into question, because they
happen to contradict the prevailing theory, according to which a soil is
said to become more or less impoverished, in proportion to the large or
small amount of organic and mineral soil constituents carried off in the
produce.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>
“That is well said,” I remarked, “and very truly; but I will not
interrupt the reading.”</p>

<p>“In the course of a long residence,” continues Dr. Vœlcker, “in a
purely agricultural district, I&nbsp;have often been struck with the
remarkably healthy appearance and good yield of wheat, on land from
which a heavy crop of clover-hay was obtained in the preceding year.
I&nbsp;have likewise had frequent opportunities of observing, that, as a
rule, wheat grown on part of a field whereon clover has been twice mown
for hay, is better than the produce of that on the part of the same
field on which the clover has been mown only once for hay, and
afterwards fed off by sheep. These observations, extending over a number
of years, led me to inquire into the reasons why clover is specially
well fitted to prepare land for wheat; and in this paper, I&nbsp;shall
endeavor, as the result of my experiments on the subject, to give an
intelligible explanation of the fact, that clover is so excellent a
preparatory crop for wheat, as it is practically known to&nbsp;be.</p>

<p>“By those taking a superficial view of the subject, it may be
suggested that any injury likely to be caused by the removal of a
certain amount of fertilizing matter, is altogether insignificant, and
more than compensated for, by the benefit which results from the
abundant growth of clover-roots, and the physical improvement in the
soil, which takes place in their decomposition. Looking, however, more
closely into the matter, it will be found that in a good crop of
clover-hay, a&nbsp;very considerable amount of both mineral and organic
substances is carried off the land, and that, if the total amount of
such constituents in a crop had to be regarded exclusively as a measure
for determining the relative degrees in which different farm crops
exhaust the soil, clover would have to be described as about the most
exhausting crop in the entire rotation.</p>

large amount of nitrogen, and remove from the soil an enormous quantity
of mineral matters, abounding in lime and potash, and containing also a
good deal of phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>“Leaving for a moment the question untouched, whether the nitrogen
contained in the clover, is derived from the soil, or from the
atmosphere, or partly from the one, and partly from the other, no
question can arise as to the original source from which the mineral
matters in the clover produce are derived. In relation, therefore, to
the ash-constituents, clover must be regarded as one of the most
exhausting crops usually cultivated in this country. This appears
strikingly to be the case, when we compare the preceding figures with
the quantity of mineral matters which an average crop of wheat removes
from an acre of land.</p>

<p>“The total quantity of ash constituents carried off the land, in an
average crop of wheat, thus amounts to only 175 lbs. per acre, whilst a
good crop of clover removes as much as 672 lbs.</p>

<p>“Nearly two-thirds of the total amount of mineral in the grain and
straw of one acre of wheat, consists of silica, of which there is an
ample supply in almost every soil. The restoration of silica, therefore,
need not trouble us in any way, especially as there is not a single
instance on record, proving that silica, even in a soluble condition,
has ever been applied to land, with the slightest advantage to corn, or
grass-crops, which are rich in silica, and which, for this reason, may
be assumed to be particularly grateful for it in a soluble state.
Silica, indeed, if at all capable of producing a beneficial effect,
ought to be useful to these crops, either by strengthening the straw, or
stems of graminaceous plants, or otherwise benefiting them; but, after
deducting the amount of silica from the
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
total amount of mineral matters in the wheat produced from one acre,
only a trifling quantity of other and more valuable fertilizing ash
constituents of plants will be left. On comparing the relative amounts
of phosphoric acid, and potash, in an average crop of wheat, and a good
crop of clover-hay, it will be seen that one acre of clover-hay contains
as much phosphoric acid, as two and one-half acres of wheat, and as much
potash as the produce from five acres of the same crop. Clover thus
unquestionably removes from the land very much more mineral matter than
does wheat; wheat, notwithstanding, succeeds remarkably well after
clover.</p>

<p>“Four tons of clover-hay, or the produce of an acre, contains, as
already stated, 224 lbs. of nitrogen, or calculated as ammonia, 272
lbs.</p>

<p>“Assuming the grain of wheat to furnish 1.78 per cent of nitrogen,
and wheat-straw, .64 per cent, and assuming also that 1,500 lbs. of
corn, and 3,000 lbs. of straw, represent the average produce per acre,
there will be in the grain of wheat, per acre, 26.7 lbs. of nitrogen,
and in the straw, 19.2 lbs., or in both together, 46 lbs. of nitrogen;
in round numbers, equal to about 55 lbs. of ammonia, which is only about
one-fifth the quantity of nitrogen in the produce of an acre of clover.
Wheat, it is well known, is specially benefited by the application of
nitrogenous manures, and as clover carries off so large a quantity of
nitrogen, it is natural to expect the yield of wheat, after clover, to
fall short of what the land might be presumed to produce without manure,
before a crop of clover was taken from it. Experience, however, has
proved the fallacy of this presumption, for the result is exactly the
opposite, inasmuch as a better and heavier crop of wheat is produced
than without the intercalation of clover. What, it may be asked, is the
explanation of this apparent anomaly?</p>

<p>“In taking up this inquiry, I was led to pass in review the
celebrated and highly important experiments, undertaken by Mr. Lawes and
Dr. Gilbert, on the continued growth of wheat on the same soil, for a
long succession of years, and to examine, likewise carefully, many
points, to which attention is drawn, by the same authors in their
memoirs on the growth of red clover by different manures, and on the
Lois Weedon plan of growing wheat. Abundant and most convincing evidence
is supplied by these indefatigable experimenters, that the
wheat-producing powers of a soil are not increased in any sensible
degree by the liberal supply of all the mineral matters, which enter
into the composition of the ash of wheat, and that the abstraction of
these mineral matters from the soil, in any much larger proportions than
can possibly take place
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
under ordinary cultivation, in no wise affects the yield of wheat,
provided there be at the same time a liberal supply of available
nitrogen within the soil itself. The amount of the latter, therefore, is
regarded by Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, as the measure of the increased
produce of grain which a soil furnishes.</p>

<p>“In conformity with these views, the farmer, when he wishes to
increase the yield of his wheat, finds it to his advantage to have
recourse to ammoniacal, or other nitrogenous manures, and depends more
or less entirely upon the soil, for the supply of the necessary mineral
or ash-constituents of wheat, having found such a supply to be amply
sufficient for his requirements. As far, therefore, as the removal from
the soil of a large amount of mineral soil-constituents, by the
clover-crop, is concerned, the fact viewed in the light of the
Rothamsted experiments, becomes at once intelligible; for,
notwithstanding the abstraction of over 600 lbs. of mineral matter by a
crop of clover, the succeeding wheat-crop does not suffer. Inasmuch,
however, as we have seen, that not only much mineral matter is carried
off the land in a crop of clover, but also much nitrogen, we might, in
the absence of direct evidence to the contrary, be led to suspect that
wheat, after clover, would not be a good crop; whereas, the fact is
exactly the reverse.</p>

<p>“It is worthy of notice, that nitrogenous manures, which have such a
marked and beneficial effect upon wheat, do no good, but in certain
combinations, in some seasons, do positive harm to clover. Thus, Messrs.
Lawes and Gilbert, in a series of experiments on the growth of
red-clover, by different manures, obtained 14 tons of fresh green
produce, equal to about three and three-fourths tons of clover hay, from
the unmanured portion of the experimental field; and where sulphates of
potash, soda, and magnesia, or sulphate of potash and superphosphate of
lime were employed, 17 to 18 tons, (equal to from about four and
one-half to nearly five tons of hay), were obtained. When salts of
ammonia were added to the mineral manures, the produce of clover-hay
was, upon the whole, less than where the mineral manures were used
alone. The wheat, grown after the clover, on the unmanured plot, gave,
however, 29½ bushels of corn, whilst in the adjoining field, where wheat
was grown after wheat, without manure, only 15½ bushels of corn per acre
were obtained. Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert notice especially, that in the
clover-crop of the preceding year, very much larger quantities, both of
mineral matters and of nitrogen, were taken from the land, than were
removed in the unmanured wheat-crop in the same year, in the adjoining
field. Notwithstanding this, the soil from which the clover had been
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<a name = "page142" id = "page142"> </a>
taken, was in a condition to yield 14 bushels more wheat, per acre, than
that upon which wheat had been previously grown; the yield of wheat,
after clover, in these experiments, being fully equal to that in another
field, where large quantities of manure were used.</p>

<p>“Taking all these circumstances into account, is there not
presumptive evidence, that, notwithstanding the removal of a large
amount of nitrogen in the clover-hay, an abundant store of available
nitrogen is left in the soil, and also that in its relations towards
nitrogen in the soil, clover differs essentially from wheat? The results
of our experience in the growth of the two crops, appear to indicate
that, whereas the growth of the wheat rapidly exhausts the land of its
available nitrogen, that of clover, on the contrary, tends somehow or
other to accumulate nitrogen within the soil itself. If this can be
shown to be the case, an intelligible explanation of the fact that
clover is so useful as a preparatory crop for wheat, will be found in
the circumstance, that, during the growth of clover, nitrogenous food,
for which wheat is particularly grateful, is either stored up or
rendered available in the soil.</p>

<p>“An explanation, however plausible, can hardly be accepted as
correct, if based mainly on data, which, although highly probable, are
not proved to be based on fact. In chemical inquiries, especially,
nothing must be taken for granted, that has not been proved by direct
experiment. The following questions naturally suggest themselves in
reference to this subject: What is the amount of nitrogen in soils of
different characters? What is the amount more particularly after a good,
and after an indifferent crop of clover? Why is the amount of nitrogen
in soils, larger after clover, than after wheat and other crops? Is the
nitrogen present in a condition in which it is available and useful to
wheat? And lastly, are there any other circumstances, apart from the
supply of nitrogenous matter in the soil, which help to account for the
beneficial effects of clover as a preparatory crop for wheat?</p>

<p>“In order to throw some light on these questions, and, if possible,
to give distinct answers to at least some of them, I, years ago, when
residing at Cirencester, began a series of experiments; and more
recently, I&nbsp;have been fortunate enough to obtain the co-operation
of Mr. Robert Valentine, of Leighton Buzzard, who kindly undertook to
supply me with materials for my analysis.</p>

<p>“My first experiments were made on a thin, calcareous, clay soil,
resting on oolitic limestone, and producing generally a fair crop of
red-clover. The clover-field formed the slope of a rather steep hillock,
and varied much in depth. At the top of the hill, the soil became very
stony at a depth of four inches, so that it could only
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<a name = "page143" id = "page143"> </a>
with difficulty be excavated to a depth of six inches, when the bare
limestone-rock made its appearance. At the bottom of the field the soil
was much deeper, and the clover stronger, than at the upper part. On the
brow of the hill, where the clover appeared to be strong, a&nbsp;square
yard was measured out; and at a little distance off, where the clover
was very bad, a&nbsp;second square yard was measured; in both plots, the
soil being taken up to a depth of six inches. The soil, where the clover
was good, may be distinguished from the other, by being marked as No. 1,
and that where it was bad, as No.&nbsp;2.</p>


<h6 class = "section">CLOVER-SOIL NO. 1. (GOOD CLOVER).</h6>

<p>“The roots having first been shaken out to free them as much as
possible from the soil, were then washed once or twice with cold
distilled water, and, after having been dried for a little while in the
sun, were weighed, when the square yard produced 1 lb. 10½ oz. of
cleaned clover-roots, in an air-dry state; an acre of land, or 4,840
square yards, accordingly yielded, in a depth of six inches, 3.44 tons,
or 3½ tons in round numbers, of clover-roots.</p>

<p>“Fully dried in a water-bath, the roots were found to contain
altogether 44.67 per cent of water, and on being burnt in a platinum
capsule, yielded 6.089 of ash. A&nbsp;portion of the dried, finely
powdered and well mixed roots, was burned with soda lime, in a
combustion tube, and the nitrogen contained in the roots otherwise
determined in the usual way. Accordingly, the following is the general
composition of the roots from the soil No. 1:</p>

<p>“Assuming the whole field to have produced 3½ tons of clover-roots,
per acre, there will be 99.636 lbs., or in round numbers, 100 lbs. of
nitrogen in the clover-roots from one acre; or, about twice as much
nitrogen as is present in the average produce of an acre of wheat.”</p>

<p>“That is a remarkable fact,” said the Deacon, “as I understand
nitrogen is the great thing needed by wheat, and yet the <i>roots</i>
alone of the clover, contain twice as much nitrogen as an average crop
of wheat. Go on Charley, it is quite interesting.”</p>

<p>“The soil,” continues Dr. Vœlcker, “which had been separated from the
roots, was passed through a sieve to deprive it of any stones it might
contain. It was then partially dried, and the nitrogen
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>

in it determined in the usual manner, by combustion with soda-lime, when
it yielded .313 per cent of nitrogen, equal to .38 of ammonia, in one
combustion; and .373 per cent of nitrogen, equal to .46 of ammonia, in a
second determination.</p>

<p>“This ash was obtained from clover-roots, which yielded, when
perfectly dry, in round numbers, eight per cent of ash. Clover-roots,
washed quite clean, and separated from all soil, yield about five per
cent of ash; but it is extremely difficult to clean a large quantity of
fibrous roots from all dirt, and the preceding analysis distinctly
shows, that the ash of the clover-roots, analyzed by me, was
mechanically mixed with a good deal of fine soil, for oxide of iron, and
alumina, and insoluble silicious matter in any quantity, are not normal
constituents of plant-ashes. Making allowance for soil contamination,
the ash of clover-roots, it will be noticed, contains much lime and
potash, as well as an appreciable amount of phosphoric and sulphuric
acid. On the decay of the clover-roots, these and other mineral
fertilizing matters are left in the surface-soil in a readily available
condition, and in considerable proportions, when the clover stands well.
Although a crop of clover removes much mineral matter from the soil, it
must be borne in mind, that its roots extract from the land, soluble
mineral fertilizing
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<a name = "page146" id = "page146"> </a>
matters, which, on the decay of the roots, remain in the land in a
prepared and more readily available form, than that in which they
originally occur. The benefits arising to wheat, from the growth of
clover, may thus be due partly to this preparation and concentration of
mineral food in the surface-soil.</p>

<p>“The clover on the hillside field, on the whole, turned out a very
good crop; and, as the plant stood the winter well, and this field was
left another season in clover, without being plowed up, I&nbsp;availed
myself of the opportunity of making, during the following season,
a&nbsp;number of experiments similar to those of the preceding year.
This time, however, I&nbsp;selected for examination, a&nbsp;square yard
of soil, from a spot on the brow of the hill, where the clover was thin,
and the soil itself stony at a depth of four inches; and another plot of
one square yard at the bottom of the hill, from a place where the clover
was stronger than that on the brow of the hill, and the soil at a depth
of six inches contained no large stones.</p>

<h5>EXPERIMENTS ON CLOVER-SOILS FROM BURCOTT LODGE FARM, LEIGHTON
BUZZARD.</h5>

<p>“The soils for the next experiments, were kindly supplied to me, in
1866, by Robert Valentine, of Burcott Lodge, who also sent me some notes
respecting the growth and yield of clover-hay and seed on this soil.</p>

<p>“Foreign seed, at the rate of 12 lbs. per acre, was sown with a crop
of wheat, which yielded five quarters per acre the previous year.</p>

<p>“The first crop of clover was cut down on the 25th of June, 1866, and
carried on June 30th. The weather was very warm, from the time of
cutting until the clover was carted, the thermometer standing at 80
Fahr. every day. The clover was turned in the swath, on the second day
after it was cut; on the fourth day, it was turned over and put into
small heaps of about 10 lbs. each; and on the fifth day, these were
collected into larger cocks, and then stacked.</p>

<p>“The best part of an 11-acre field, produced nearly three tons of
clover-hay, sun-dried, per acre; the whole field yielding on an average,
2½ tons per acre. This result was obtained by weighing the stack three
months after the clover was carted. The second crop was cut on the 21st
of August, and carried on the 27th, the weight being nearly 30 cwt. of
hay per acre. Thus the two cuttings produced just about four tons of
clover-hay per acre.</p>

<p>“The 11 acres were divided into two parts. About one-half was mown
for hay a second time, and the other part left for seed. The produce of
the second half of the 11-acre field, was cut on the 8th of October, and
carried on the 10th. It yielded in round numbers, 3 cwt. of clover-seed
per acre, the season being very unfavorable for clover-seed. The second
crop of clover, mown for hay, was rather too ripe, and just beginning to
show seed.</p>

<p>“A square foot of soil, 18 inches deep, was dug from the second
portion of the land which produced the clover-hay and clover-seed.</p>

described as a stiff clay soil, containing a sufficiency of lime,
potash, and phosphoric acid, to meet all the requirements of the

by deep culture; by being smashed up into rough clods, early in autumn,
and by being exposed in this state to the crumbling effects of the air,
it now yields good corn and forage crops.</p>

<p>“The proportion of phosphoric acid in six inches of surface soil, it
will be seen, amounted to about two-tenths per cent; a&nbsp;proportion
of the whole soil, so small that it may appear insufficient for the
production of a good corn-crop. However, when calculated to the acre, we
find that six inches of surface soil in an acre of land, actually
contain over two tons of phosphoric acid. An average crop of wheat,
assumed to be 25 bushels of grain, at 60 lbs. per
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
<a name = "page152" id = "page152"> </a>
bushel, and 3,000 lbs. of straw, removes from the land on which it is
grown, 20 lbs. of phosphoric acid. The clover-soil analyzed by me,
consequently contains an amount of phosphoric acid in a depth of only
six inches, which is equal to that present in 247½ average crops of
wheat; or supposing that, by good cultivation and in favorable seasons,
the average yield of wheat could be doubled, and 50 bushels of grain, at
60 lbs. a&nbsp;bushel, and 6,000 lbs. of straw could be raised, 124 of
such heavy wheat-crops would contain no more phosphoric acid than
actually occurred in six inches of this clover-soil per acre.</p>

<p>“The mere presence of such an amount of phosphoric acid in a soil,
however, by no means proves its sufficiency for the production of so
many crops of wheat; for, in the first place, it can not be shown that
the whole of the phosphoric acid found by analysis, occurs in the soil
in a readily available combination; and, in the second place, it is
quite certain that the root-fibres of the wheat-plant can not reach and
pick up, so to speak, every particle of phosphoric acid, even supposing
it to occur in the soil in a form most conducive to ‘ready assimilation
by the plant.’</p>

<p>“The calculation is not given in proof of a conclusion which would be
manifestly absurd, but simply as an illustration of the enormous
quantity in an acre of soil six inches deep, of a constituent forming
the smaller proportions of the whole weight of an acre of soil of that
limited depth. It shows the existence of a practically unlimited amount
of the most important mineral constituents of plants, and clearly points
out the propriety of rendering available to plants, the natural
resources of the soil in plant-food; to draw, in fact, up the mineral
wealth of the soil, by thoroughly working the land, and not leaving it
unutilized as so much dead capital.”</p>

than twice the weight of roots obtained from the soil of the same field
where the clover was twice mown for hay.</p>

<p>“In round numbers, the 3,622 lbs. of clover-roots from the land mown
once, and afterwards left for seed, contained 51½ lbs. of nitrogen.</p>

<p>“The roots from the soil after clover-seed, it will be noticed, were
not so clean as the preceding sample, nevertheless, they yielded more
nitrogen. In 64.76 of organic matter, we have here 1.702 of nitrogen,
whereas, in the case of the roots from the part of the field where the
clover was twice mown for hay, we have in 81.33 parts, that is, much
more organic matter, and 1.635, or rather less of nitrogen. It is
evident, therefore, that the organic matter in the soil after
clover-seed, occurs in a more advanced stage of decomposition, than
found in the clover-roots from the part of the field twice mown. In the
manure, in which the decay of such and similar organic remains proceeds,
much of the non-nitrogenous, or carbonaceous matters, of which these
remains chiefly,

what is left behind, is presented to us in fresh and rotten dung; in
long or fresh dung, the percentage of organic matter, consisting chiefly
of very imperfectly decomposed straw, being larger, and that of nitrogen

<p>“It will be seen that not only was the amount of large clover-roots
greater in the part where clover was grown for seed, but that likewise
the different layers of soil were in every instance richer in nitrogen
after clover-seed, than after clover mown twice for hay.</p>

<p>“Reasons are given in the beginning of this paper which it is hoped
will have convinced the reader, that the fertility of land is not so
much measured by the amount of ash constituents of plants which it
contains, as by the amount of nitrogen, which, together with an excess
of such ash constituents, it contains in an available form. It has been
shown likewise, that the removal from the soil of a large amount of
mineral matter in a good clover-crop, in conformity with many direct
field experiments, is not likely in any degree to affect the wheat-crop,
and that the yield of wheat on soils under ordinary cultivation,
according to the experience of many farmers, and the direct and numerous
experiments of Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, rises or falls, other
circumstances being equal, with the supply of available nitrogenous food
which is given to the wheat. This being the case, we can not doubt that
the benefits arising from the growth of clover to the succeeding wheat,
are mainly due to the fact that an immense amount of nitrogenous food
accumulates in the soil during the growth of clover.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<a name = "page158" id = "page158"> </a>
“This accumulation of nitrogenous plant-food, specially useful to cereal
crops, is, as shown in the preceding experiments, much greater when
clover is grown for seed, than when it is made into hay. This affords an
intelligible explanation of a fact long observed by good practical men,
although denied by others who decline to accept their experience as
resting upon trustworthy evidence, because, as they say, land cannot
become more fertile when a crop is grown upon it for seed, which is
carried off, than when that crop is cut down and the produce consumed on
the land. The chemical points brought forward in the course of this
inquiry, show plainly that mere speculation as to what can take place in
a soil, and what not, do not much advance the true theory of certain
agricultural practices. It is only by carefully investigating subjects
like the one under consideration, that positive proofs are given,
showing the correctness of intelligent observers in the fields. Many
years ago, I&nbsp;made a great many experiments relative to the
chemistry of farm-yard manure, and then showed, amongst other
particulars, that manure, spread at once on the land, need not there and
then be plowed in, inasmuch as neither a broiling sun, nor a sweeping
and drying wind will cause the slightest loss of ammonia; and that,
therefore, the old-fashioned farmer who carts his manure on the land as
soon as he can, and spreads it at once, but who plows it in at his
convenience, acts in perfect accordance with correct chemical principles
involved in the management of farm-yard manure. On the present occasion,
my main object has been to show, not merely by reasoning on the subject,
but by actual experiments, that the larger the amounts of nitrogen,
potash, soda, lime, phosphoric acid, etc., which are removed from the
land in a clover-crop, the better it is, nevertheless, made thereby for
producing in the succeeding year an abundant crop of wheat, other
circumstances being favorable to its growth.</p>

<p>“Indeed, no kind of manure can be compared in point of efficacy for
wheat, to the manuring which the land gets in a really good crop of
clover. The farmer who wishes to derive the full benefit from his
clover-lay, should plow it up for wheat as soon as possible in the
autumn, and leave it in a rough state as long as is admissible, in order
that the air may find free access into the land, and the organic remains
left in so much abundance in a good crop of clover be changed into
plant-food; more especially, in other words, in order that the crude
nitrogenous organic matter in the clover-roots and decaying leaves, may
have time to become transformed into ammoniacal compounds, and these, in
the course of time, into nitrates, which I am strongly inclined to think
is the form in which
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<a name = "page159" id = "page159"> </a>
nitrogen is assimilated, par excellence by cereal crops, and in which,
at all events, it is more efficacious than in any other state of
combination wherein it may be used as a fertilizer.</p>

<p>“When the clover-lay is plowed up early, the decay of the clover is
sufficiently advanced by the time the young wheat-plant stands in need
of readily available nitrogenous food, and this being uniformly
distributed through the whole of the cultivated soil, is ready to
benefit every single plant. This equal and abundant distribution of
food, peculiarly valuable to cereals, is a great advantage, and speaks
strongly in favor of clover as a preparatory crop for wheat.</p>

<p>“Nitrate of soda, an excellent spring top-dressing for wheat and
cereals in general, in some seasons fails to produce as good an effect
as in others. In very dry springs, the rainfall is not sufficient to
wash it properly into the soil and to distribute it equally, and in very
wet seasons it is apt to be washed either into the drains or into a
stratum of the soil not accessible to the roots of the young wheat. As,
therefore, the character of the approaching season can not usually be
predicted, the application of nitrate of soda to wheat is always
attended with more or less uncertainty.</p>

<p>“The case is different, when a good crop of clover-hay has been
obtained from the land on which wheat is intended to be grown
afterwards. An enormous quantity of nitrogenous organic matter, as we
have seen, is left in the land after the removal of the clover-crop; and
these remains gradually decay and furnish ammonia, which at first and
during the colder months of the year, is retained by the well known
absorbing properties which all good wheat-soils possess. In spring, when
warmer weather sets in, and the wheat begins to make a push, these
ammonia compounds in the soil are by degrees oxidized into nitrates; and
as this change into food peculiarly favorable to young cereal plants,
proceeds slowly but steadily, we have in the soil itself, after clover,
a&nbsp;source from which nitrates are continuously produced; so that it
does not much affect the final yield of wheat, whether heavy rains
remove some or all of the nitrate present in the soil. The clover
remains thus afford a more continuous source from which nitrates are
produced, and greater certainty for a good crop of wheat than when
recourse is had to nitrogenous top-dressings in the spring.</p>


<h6 class = "section">SUMMARY.</h6>

<p>“The following are some of the chief points of interest which I have
endeavored fully to develope in the preceding pages:</p>

<p>“1. A good crop of clover removes from the soil more potash,
<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<a name = "page160" id = "page160"> </a>
phosphoric acid, lime, and other mineral matters, which enter into the
composition of the ashes of our cultivated crops, than any other crop
usually grown in this country.</p>

<p>“2. There is fully three times as much nitrogen in a crop of clover
as in the average produce of the grain and straw of wheat per acre.</p>

<p>“3. Notwithstanding the large amount of nitrogenous matter and of
ash-constituents of plants, in the produce of an acre, clover is an
excellent preparatory crop for wheat.</p>

<p>“4. During the growth of clover, a&nbsp;large amount of nitrogenous
matter accumulates in the soil.</p>

<p>“5. This accumulation, which is greatest in the surface soil, is due
to decaying leaves dropped during the growth of clover, and to an
abundance of roots, containing, when dry, from one and three-fourths to
two per cent of nitrogen.</p>

<p>“6. The clover-roots are stronger and more numerous, and more leaves
fall on the ground when clover is grown for seed, than when it is mown
for hay; in consequence, more nitrogen is left after clover-seed, than
after hay, which accounts for wheat yielding a better crop after
clover-seed than after hay.</p>

<p>“7. The development of roots being checked, when the produce, in a
green condition, is fed off by sheep, in all probability, leaves still
less nitrogenous matter in the soil than when clover is allowed to get
riper and is mown for hay; thus, no doubt, accounting for the
observation made by practical men, that, notwithstanding the return of
the produce in the sheep excrements, wheat is generally stronger, and
yields better, after clover mown for hay, than when the clover is fed
off green by sheep.</p>

<p>“8. The nitrogenous matters in the clover remains, on their gradual
decay, are finally transformed into nitrates, thus affording a
continuous source of food on which cereal crops specially delight to
grow.</p>

<p>“9. There is strong presumptive evidence that the nitrogen which
exists in the air, in shape of ammonia and nitric acid, and descends, in
these combinations, with the rain which falls on the ground, satisfies,
under ordinary circumstances, the requirements of the clover-crop. This
crop causes a large accumulation of nitrogenous matters, which are
gradually changed in the soil into nitrates. The atmosphere thus
furnishes nitrogenous food to the succeeding wheat indirectly, and, so
to say, gratis.</p>

<p>“10. Clover not only provides abundance of nitrogenous food, but
delivers this food in a readily available form (as nitrates), more
gradually and continuously, and, consequently, with more certainty
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
of a good result, than such food can be applied to the land in the shape
of nitrogenous spring top-dressings.”</p>

<p>“Thank you Charley,” said the Doctor, “<i>that is the most remarkable
paper I ever listened to</i>. I&nbsp;do not quite know what to think of
it. We shall have to examine it carefully.”</p>

<p>“The first three propositions in the Summary,” said I, “are
unquestionably true. Proposition No. 4, is equally true, but we must be
careful what meaning we attach to the word ‘accumulate.’ The idea is,
that clover gathers up the nitrogen in the soil. It does not
<i>increase</i> the absolute amount of nitrogen. It accumulates
it&mdash;brings it together<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has close quote">.</ins></p>

<p>“Proposition No. 5, will not be disputed; and I think we may accept
No. 6, also, though we can not be sure that allowing clover to go to
seed, had anything to do with the increased quantity of clover-roots<ins
class = "correction" title = "text has close quote">.</ins></p>

<p>“Proposition No. 7, may or may not be true. We have no proof, only a
‘probability;’ and the same may be said in regard to propositions Nos.
8, 9, and 10.”</p>

<p>The Deacon seemed uneasy. He did not like these remarks. He had got
the impression, while Charley was reading, that much more was proved
than Dr. Vœlcker claims in his Summary.</p>

<p>“I thought,” said he, “that on the part of the field where the clover
was allowed to go to seed, Dr. Vœlcker found a great increase in the
amount of nitrogen.”</p>

<p>“That seems to be the general impression,” said the Doctor, “but in
point of fact, we have no proof that the growth of clover, either for
hay or for seed, had anything to do with the quantity of nitrogen and
phosphoric acid found in the soil. The <i>facts</i> given by Dr.
Vœlcker, are exceedingly interesting. Let us look at them<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has close quote">:</ins></p>

<p>“A field of 11 acres was sown to winter-wheat, and seeded down in the
spring, with 13 lbs. per acre of clover. The wheat yielded 40 bushels
per acre. The next year, on the 25th of June, the clover was mown for
hay. We are told that ‘the <i>best part</i> of the field yielded three
tons (6,720 lbs.) of clover-hay per acre; the whole field averaging 2½
tons (5,600 lbs.) per acre<ins class = "correction" title =
"text also has closing double quote">.’</ins></p>

<p>“We are not informed how much land there was of the ‘best part,’ but
assuming that it was half the field, the poorer part must have yielded
only 4,480 lbs. of hay per acre, or only two-thirds as much as the
other. This shows that there was considerable difference in the quality
or condition of the land.</p>

<p>“After the field was mown for hay, it was divided into two parts: one
part was mown again for hay, August 21st, and yielded about
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162" id = "page162"> </a>
30 cwt. (3,360 lbs.) of hay per acre; the other half was allowed to grow
six or seven weeks longer, and was then (October 8th), cut for seed. The
yield was a little over 5½ bushels of seed per acre. Whether the clover
allowed to grow for seed, was on the richer or poorer half of the field,
we are not informed.</p>

<p>“Dr. Vœlcker then analyzed the soil. That from the part of the field
mown twice for hay, contained per acre:</p>

<p>“Dr. Vœlcker also ascertained the amount and composition of the
clover-<i>roots</i> growing in the soil on the two parts of the field.
On the <i>part mown twice for hay</i>, the roots contained per acre 24½
lbs. of nitrogen. On the <i>part mown once for hay, and then for
seed</i>, the roots contained 51½ lbs. of nitrogen per acre.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said the Doctor, “these facts are very interesting, <i>but
there is no sort of evidence tending to show that the clover has
anything to do with increasing or decreasing the quantity of nitrogen or
phosphoric acid found in the soil</i><ins class = "correction" title =
"close quote?">.”</ins></p>

<p>“There was more clover-roots per acre, where the clover was allowed
to go to seed. But that may be because the soil happened to be richer on
this part of the field. There was, in the first six inches of the soil,
3,350 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, on one-half of the field, and 4,725
lbs. on the other half; and it is not at all surprising that on the
latter half there should be a greater growth of clover and clover-roots.
To suppose that during the six or seven weeks while the clover was
maturing its seed, the clover-plants could accumulate 1,375 lbs. of
nitrogen, is absurd.”</p>

<p>“But Dr. Vœlcker,” said the Deacon, “states, and states truly, that
‘more leaves fall on the ground when clover is grown for seed, than when
it is mown for hay; and, consequently, more nitrogen is left after
clover-seed than after hay, which accounts for wheat yielding a better
crop after clover-seed than after hay.’”</p>

<p>“This is all true,” said the Doctor, “but we can not accept Dr.
Vœlcker’s analyses as proving it. To account in this way for the 1,375
lbs. of nitrogen, we should have to suppose that the clover-plants, in
going to seed, shed <i>one hundred tons</i> of dry clover-leaves
<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
<a name = "page163" id = "page163"> </a>
per acre! The truth of the matter seems to be, that the part of the
field on which the clover was allowed to go to seed, was naturally much
richer than the other part, and consequently produced a greater growth
of clover and clover-roots.”</p>

<p>We can not find anything in these experiments tending to show that we
can make land rich by growing clover and selling the crop. The analyses
of the soil show that in the first eighteen inches of the surface-soil,
there was 6,550 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, on one part of the field, and
10,300 lbs. on the other part. The clover did not create this nitrogen,
or bring it from the atmosphere. The wheat with which the clover was
seeded down, yielded 40 bushels per acre. If the field had been sown to
wheat again, it probably would not have yielded over 25 bushels per
acre&mdash;and that for want of available nitrogen. And yet the clover
got nitrogen enough for over four tons of clover-hay; or as much
nitrogen as a crop of wheat of 125 bushels per acre, and 7½ tons of
straw would remove from the land.</p>

<p>Now what does this prove? There was, in 18 inches of the soil on the
poorest part of the field, 6,550 lbs. of nitrogen per acre. A&nbsp;crop
of wheat of 50 bushels per acre, and twice that weight of straw, would
require about 92 lbs. of nitrogen. But the wheat can not get this amount
from the soil, while the clover can get <i>double the quantity</i>. And
the only explanation I can give, is, that the clover-roots can take up
nitrogen from a weaker solution in the soil than wheat-roots can.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“These experiments of Dr. Vœlcker,” said I, “give me great
encouragement. Here is a soil, ‘originally rather unproductive, but much
improved by deep culture; by being smashed up into rough clods early in
autumn, and by being exposed in this state to the crumbling effects of
the air.’ It now produces 40 bushels of wheat per acre, and part of the
field yielded three tons of clover-hay, per acre, the first cutting, and
5½ bushels of clover-seed afterwards&mdash;and that in a very
unfavorable season for clover-seed.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>You will find that the farmers in England do not expect to make their
land rich, by growing clover and selling the produce. After they have
got their land rich, by good cultivation, and the liberal use of animal
and artificial manures, they may expect a good crop of wheat from the
roots of the clover. But they take good care to feed out the clover
itself on the farm, in connection with turnips and oil-cake, and thus
make rich manure.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>
And so it is in this country. Much as we hear about the value of clover
for manure, even those who extol it the highest do not depend upon it
alone for bringing up and maintaining the fertility of their farms. The
men who raise the largest crops and make the most money by farming, do
not sell clover-hay. They do not look to the roots of the clover for
making a poor soil rich. They are, to a man, good cultivators. They work
their land thoroughly and kill the weeds. They keep good stock, and feed
liberally, and make good manure. They use lime, ashes, and plaster, and
are glad to draw manure from the cities and villages, and muck from the
swamps, and not a few of them buy artificial manures. In the hands of
such farmers, clover is a grand renovating crop. It gathers up the
fertility of the soil, and the roots alone of a large crop, often
furnish food enough for a good crop of corn, potatoes, or wheat. But if
your land was not in good heart to start with, you would not get the
large crop of clover; and if you depend on the clover-roots alone, the
time is not far distant when your large crops of clover will be things
of the past.</p>

to make a little mistake; and when you take only a square foot of land,
as was the case with Nos. 5 and 6, the mistake is multiplied by 43,560.
Still, I&nbsp;give the table for what it is worth.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">165</span>
<a name = "page165" id = "page165"> </a>
Nos. 1 and 2 are from a one-year-old crop of clover. The field was a
calcareous clay soil. It was somewhat hilly; or, perhaps, what we here,
in Western New York, should call “rolling land.” The soil on the brow of
the hill, “was very stony at a depth of four inches, so that it could
only with difficulty be excavated to six inches, when the bare
limestone-rock made its appearance.”</p>

<p>A square yard was selected on this shallow soil, where the clover was
good; and the roots, air-dried, weighed at the rate of 7,705 lbs. per
acre, and contained 100 lbs. of nitrogen. A&nbsp;few yards distance, on
the same soil, where the clover was bad, the acre of roots contained
only 31 lbs. of nitrogen per acre.</p>

<p>So far, so good. We can well understand this result. Chemistry has
little to do with it. There was a good stand of clover on the one plot,
and a poor one on the other. And the conclusion to be drawn from it is,
that it is well worth our while to try to secure a good catch of
clover.</p>

<p>“But, suppose,” said the Doctor, “No. 2 had happened to have been
pastured by sheep, and No. 1 allowed to go to seed, what magic there
would have been in the above figures!”</p>

<p>Nos. 3 and 4 are from the same field, the second year. No. 4 is from
a square yard of thin clover on the brow of the hill, and No. 3, from
the richer, deeper land towards the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>There is very little difference between them. The roots of thin
clover from the brow of the hill, contain five lbs. more nitrogen per
acre, than the roots on the deeper soil.</p>

<p>If we can depend on the figures, we may conclude that on our poor
stony “knolls,” the clover has larger and longer roots than on the
richer parts of the field. We know that roots will run long distances
and great depths in search of food and water.</p>

<p>Nos. 5 and 6 are from a heavy crop of one-year-old clover. No. 5 was
mown twice for hay, producing, in the two cuttings, over four tons of
hay per acre. No. 6 was in the same field, the only difference being
that the clover, instead of being cut the second time for hay, was
allowed to stand a few weeks longer to ripen its seed. You will see that
the latter has more roots than the former.</p>

<p>There are 24½ lbs. of nitrogen per acre in the one case, and 51½ lbs.
in the other. How far this is due to difference in the condition of the
land, or to the difficulties in the way of getting out all the roots
from the square yard, is a matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I have very little confidence in any of these figures.
It will be observed that I have put at the bottom of the table, the
result of an examination made in Germany. In this case, the nitrogen in
the roots of an acre of clover, amounted to 191½ lbs. per
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
acre. If we can depend on the figures, we must conclude that there were
nearly eight times as much clover-roots per acre in the German field, as
in the remarkably heavy crop of clover in the English field
No.&nbsp;5.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Deacon, “but the one was 10¼ inches deep, and the
other only six inches deep; and besides, the German experiment includes
the ‘stubble’ with the roots.”</p>

<p>The Deacon is right; and it will be well to give the complete table,
as published in the <i>American Agriculturist</i>:</p>

<p>It may be presumed, that, while these figures are not
<i>absolutely</i>, they are <i>relatively</i>, correct. In other words,
we may conclude, that red-clover leaves more nitrogen, phosphoric acid,
and potash, in the roots and stubble per acre, than any other of the
crops named.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
The gross amount of dry substance in the roots, and the gross amount of
ash per acre, are considerably exaggerated, owing to the evidently large
quantity of dirt attached to the roots and stubble. For instance, the
gross amount of ash in Lucern is given as 1,201.6 lbs. per acre; while
the total amount of lime, magnesia, potash, soda, sulphuric and
phosphoric acids, is only 342.2 lbs. per acre, leaving 859.4 lbs. as
sand, clay, iron, etc. Of the 1,919.9 lbs. of ash in the acre of
clover-roots and stubble, there are 1,429.4 lbs. of sand, clay, etc. But
even after deducting this amount of impurities from a gross total of dry
matter per acre, we still have 7,492.2 lbs. of dry roots and stubble per
acre, or nearly 3¼ tons of <i>dry</i> roots per acre. This is a very
large quantity. It is as much dry matter as is contained in 13 tons of
ordinary farm-yard, or stable-manure. And these 3¼ tons of dry
clover-roots contain 191½ lbs. of nitrogen, which is as much as is
contained in 19 tons of ordinary stable-manure. The clover-roots also
contain 74¾ lbs. of phosphoric acid per acre, or as much as is contained
in from 500 to 600 lbs. of No. 1 rectified Peruvian guano.</p>

<p>“But the phosphoric acid,” said the Doctor, “is not soluble in the
roots.” True, but it was soluble when the roots gathered it up out of
the soil.</p>

<p>“These figures,” said the Deacon, “have a very pleasant look. Those
of us who have nearly one-quarter of our land in clover every year,
ought to be making our farms very rich.”</p>

<p>“It would seem, at any rate,” said I, “that those of us who have
good, clean, well-drained, and well-worked land, that is now producing a
good growth of clover, may reasonably expect a fair crop of wheat,
barley, oats, corn, or potatoes, when we break it up and plow under all
the roots, which are equal to 13 or 19 tons of stable-manure per acre.
Whether we can or can not depend on these figures, one thing is clearly
proven, both by the chemist and the farmer, that a good clover-sod, on
well-worked soil, is a good preparation for corn and potatoes.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURES FOR WHEAT.</h6>

<p>Probably nine-tenths of all the wheat grown in Western New York, or
the “Genesee country,” from the time the land was first cleared until
1870, was raised without any manure being directly applied to the land
for this crop. Tillage and clover were what the farmers depended on.
There certainly has been no systematic manuring. The manure made during
the winter, was drawn out in the spring, and plowed under for corn. Any
manure made during the summer, in the yards, was, by the best farmers,
scraped up and
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168" id = "page168"> </a>
spread on portions of the land sown, or to be sown, with wheat. Even so
good a farmer and wheat-grower as John Johnston, rarely used manure,
(except lime, and latterly, a&nbsp;little guano), directly for wheat.
Clover and summer-fallowing were for many years the dependence of the
Western New York wheat-growers.</p>

<p>“One of the oldest and most experienced millers of Western New York,”
remarked the Doctor, “once told me that ‘ever since our farmers began to
<i>manure their land</i>, the wheat-crop had deteriorated, not only in
the yield per acre, but in the quality and quantity of the flour
obtained from it.’ It seemed a strange remark to make; but when he
explained that the farmers had given up summer-fallowing and plowing in
clover, and now sow spring crops, to be followed by winter wheat with an
occasional dressing of poor manure, it is easy to see how it may be
true.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “it is not the <i>manure</i> that hurts the wheat, but
the growth of spring crops and weeds that rob the soil of far more
plant-food than the poor, strawy manure can supply. We do not now,
really, furnish the wheat-crop as much manure or plant-food as we
formerly did when little or no manure was used, and when we depended on
summer-fallowing and plowing in clover.”</p>

<p>We must either give up the practice of sowing a spring crop, before
wheat, or we must make more and richer manure, or we must plow in more
clover. The rotation, which many of us now adopt&mdash;corn, barley,
wheat&mdash;is profitable, provided we can make our land rich enough to
produce 75 bushels of shelled corn, 50 bushels of barley, and 35 bushels
of wheat, per acre, in three years.</p>

<p>This can be done, but we shall either require a number of acres of
rich low land, or irrigated meadow, the produce of which will make
manure for the upland, or we shall have to purchase oil-cake, bran,
malt-combs, or refuse beans, to feed out with our straw and clover-hay,
or we must purchase artificial manures. Unless this is done, we must
summer-fallow more, on the heavier clay soils, sow less oats and barley;
or we must, on the lighter soils, raise and plow under more clover, or
feed it out on the farm, being careful to save and apply the manure.</p>

<p>“Better do both,” said the Doctor<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has additional close quote">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>“How?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>“You had better make all the manure you can,” continued the Doctor,
“and buy artificial manures besides.”</p>

<p>“The Doctor is right,” said I, “and in point of fact, our best
farmers are doing this very thing. They are making more manure and
buying more manure than ever before; or, to state the matter correctly,
they are buying artificial manures; and these increase the
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<a name = "page169" id = "page169"> </a>
crops, and the extra quantity of straw, corn, and clover, so obtained,
enables them to make more manure. They get cheated sometimes in their
purchases; but, on the whole, the movement is a good one, and will
result in a higher and better system of farming.”</p>

<p>I am amused at the interest and enthusiasm manifested by some of our
farmers who have used artificial manures for a year or two. They seem to
regard me as a sad old fogy, because I am now depending almost entirely
on the manures made on the farm. Years ago, I&nbsp;was laughed at
because I used guano and superphosphate. It was only yesterday, that a
young farmer, who is the local agent of this neighborhood, for a manure
manufacturer, remarked to me, “You have never used superphosphate. We
sowed it on our wheat last year, and could see to the very drill mark
how far it went. I&nbsp;would like to take your order for a ton.
I&nbsp;am sure it would pay.”</p>

<p>“We are making manure cheaper than you can sell it to me,” I replied,
“and besides, I&nbsp;do not think superphosphate is a good manure for
wheat.” &mdash;“Oh,” he exclaimed, “you would not say so if you had ever
used it.” &mdash;“Why, my dear sir,” said I, “I&nbsp;made tons of
superphosphate, and used large quantities of guano before you were born;
and if you will come into the house, I&nbsp;will show you a silver
goblet I got for a prize essay on the use of superphosphate of lime,
that I wrote more than a quarter of a century ago. I&nbsp;sent to New
York for two tons of guano, and published the result of its use on this
farm, before you were out of your cradle. And I had a ton or more of
superphosphate made for me in 1856, and some before that. I&nbsp;have
also used on this farm, many tons of superphosphate and other artificial
manures from different manufacturers, and one year I used 15 tons of
bone-dust.”</p>

<p>With ready tact, he turned the tables on me by saying: “Now I can
understand why your land is improving. It is because you have used
superphosphate and bone-dust. Order a few tons.”</p>

<p>By employing agents of this kind, the manufacturers have succeeded in
selling the farmers of Western New York thousands of tons of
superphosphate. Some farmers think it pays, and some that it does not.
We are more likely to hear of the successes than of failures. Still
there can be no doubt that superphosphate has, in many instances, proved
a valuable and profitable manure for wheat in Western New York.</p>

<p>From 200 to 300 lbs. are used per acre, and the evidence seems to
show that it is far better to <i>drill in the manure with the seed</i>
than to sow it broadcast.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>My own opinion is, that these superphosphates are not the most
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<a name = "page170" id = "page170"> </a>
economical artificial manures that could be used for wheat. They contain
too little nitrogen. Peruvian guano containing nitrogen equal to 10 per
cent of ammonia, would be, I&nbsp;think, a&nbsp;much more effective and
profitable manure. But before we discuss this question, it will be
necessary to study the results of actual experiments in the use of
various fertilizers for wheat.</p>
