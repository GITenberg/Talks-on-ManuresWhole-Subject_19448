<h5>MANURES FOR SPECIAL CROPS.</h5>

<h6 class = "section">MANURES FOR HOPS.</h6>

<p>“For hops,” said the Doctor, “there is nothing better than rich,
well-decomposed farmyard-manure&mdash;such manure as you are now making
from your pigs that are bedded with stable-manure.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said I, “and the better you feed your horses and pigs,
the better will the manure be for hops. In England, Mr. Paine, of
Surrey, made a series of experiments with different manures for hops,
and, as the result of four years trial, reported that <i>rape-cake</i>,
singly, or in combination, invariably proved the best manure for hops.
In this country, cotton-seed, or <ins class = "correction" title =
"hyphenation as in original (here and
elsewhere)">cotton-seed-cake,</ins> would be a good substitute for the
rape-cake. Whatever manure is used should be used liberally. Hops
require a large amount of labor per acre, and it is, therefore,
specially desirable to obtain a large yield per acre. This can be
accomplished only by the most lavish expenditure of manure. And all
experience seems to show that it must be manure <i>rich in nitrogen</i>.
In the hop districts of England, 25 tons of rich farmyard-manure are
applied per acre; and in addition to this, soot and rags, both rich in
nitrogen, have long been popular auxiliaries. The value of soot is due
to the fact that it contains from 12 to 15 per cent of sulphate of
ammonia, and the fact that it has been so long used with success as a
manure for hops, seems to prove that sulphate of ammonia, which
<span class = "pagenum">275</span>
<a name = "page275" id = "page275"> </a>
can now be readily obtained, could be used to advantage by our
hop-growers&mdash;say at the rate, in addition to farm-yard manure, of
500 lbs. per acre, sown broadcast early in the spring<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURES FOR TOBACCO.</h6>

<p>When tobacco is grown for wrappers, it is desirable to get a large,
strong leaf. The richest land is selected for the crop, and large
quantities of the richest and most stimulating manures are used.</p>

<p>Like cabbages, this crop requires a large amount of plant-food per
acre; and, like them, it can only be grown by constant and high
manuring. More manure must be used than the plants can take up out of
the soil, and hence it is, that land which has been used for growing
tobacco for some years, will be in high condition for other crops
without further manuring.</p>

<p>Farm-yard or stable-manure, must be the mainstay of the
tobacco-planter. With this, he can use artificial fertilizers to
advantage&mdash;such as fish-scrap, <ins class = "correction" title =
"hyphenation as in original">woollen-rags</ins>, Peruvian guano, dried
blood, slaughter-house offal, sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of soda,
etc.</p>

<p>For choice, high-flavored smoking-tobacco, the grower aims to get
quality rather than quantity. This seems to depend more on the land and
the climate than on the manures used. Superphosphate of lime would be
likely to prove advantageous in favoring the early growth and maturity
of the crop. And in raising tobacco-plants in the seed-bed,
I&nbsp;should expect good results from the use of superphosphate, raked
into the soil at the rate of three or four lbs. per square rod.</p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURES FOR INDIAN CORN.</h6>

<p>We know less about the manurial requirements of Indian corn, than of
almost any other crop we cultivate. We know that wheat, barley, oats,
and grasses, require for their maximum growth a liberal supply of
available nitrogen in the soil. And such facts and experiments as we
have, seem to indicate that the same is also true of Indian corn. It is,
at any rate, reasonable to suppose that, as Indian corn belongs to the
same botanical order as wheat, barley, oats, rye, timothy, and other
grasses, the general manurial requirements would be the same. Such,
I&nbsp;presume, is the case; and yet there seem to be some facts that
would incline us to place Indian corn with the leguminous plants, such
as clover, peas, and beans, rather than with the cereals, wheat, barley,
oats, etc.</p>

<p>“Why so,” asked the Deacon, “Indian corn does not have much in common
with beans, peas, and clover?”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">276</span>
<a name = "page276" id = "page276"> </a>
As we have shown, clover can get more nitrogen out of the soil, than
wheat, barley, and oats. And the same is true of beans and peas, though
probably not to so great an extent.</p>

<p>Now, it would seem that Indian corn can get more nitrogen out of a
soil, than wheat, barley, or oats&mdash;and to this extent, at least, we
may consider Indian corn as a renovating crop. In other words, the
Indian corn can get more nitrogen out of the soil, than wheat, barley,
and oats&mdash;and when we feed out the corn and stalks on the farm, we
have more food and more manure than if we raised and fed out a crop of
oats, barley, or wheat. If this idea is correct, then Indian corn, when
consumed on the farm, should not be classed with what the English
farmers term “white crops,” but rather with the “green crops.” In other
words, Indian corn is what old writers used to call a “fallow
crop”&mdash;or what we call a renovating crop.</p>

<p>If this is so, then the growth and consumption of Indian corn on the
farm, as is the case with clover, should leave the farm richer for
wheat, rather than poorer. I&nbsp;do not mean richer absolutely, but
richer so far as the <i>available</i> supply of plant-food is
concerned.</p>

<p>“It may be that you are right,” said the Doctor, “when corn is grown
for <i>fodder</i>, but not when grown for the grain. It is the formation
of the seed which exhausts the soil.”</p>

<p>If I could be sure that it was true of corn-fodder, I&nbsp;should
have little doubt that it is true also of corn as ordinarily grown for
grain and stalks. For, I&nbsp;think, it is clear that the grain is
formed at the expense of the stalks, and not directly from the soil. The
corn-fodder will take from the soil as much nitrogen and phosphoric acid
as the crop of corn, and the more it will take, the more it approximates
in character to clover and other renovating crops. If corn-fodder is a
renovating crop, so is the ordinary corn-crop, also, provided it is
consumed on the farm.</p>

<p>“But what makes you think,” said the Deacon, “that corn can get more
nitrogen from the soil, than wheat?”</p>

<p>“That is the real point, Deacon,” said I, “and I will ask you this
question. Suppose you had a field of wheat seeded down to clover, and
the clover failed. After harvest, you plow up half of the field and sow
it to wheat again, the other half of the field you plow in the spring,
and plant with Indian corn. Now, suppose you get 15 bushels of wheat to
the acre, how much corn do you think you would be likely to get?”</p>

<p>“Well, that depends,” said the Deacon, “but I should expect at least
30 bushels of shelled corn per acre.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, and I think most farmers would tell you the same;
<span class = "pagenum">277</span>
<a name = "page277" id = "page277"> </a>
you get twice as much corn and stalks to the acre as you would of wheat
and straw. In other words, while the wheat cannot find more nitrogen
than is necessary to produce 15 bushels of wheat and straw, the corn can
find, and does find, take up, and organize, at least twice as much
nitrogen as the wheat.”</p>

<p>If these are facts, then the remarks we have made in regard to the
value of clover as a fertilizing crop, are applicable in some degree to
Indian corn. To grow clover and sell it, will in the end impoverish the
soil; to grow clover and feed it out, will enrich the land. And the same
will be true of Indian corn. It will gather up nitrogen that the
wheat-crop can not appropriate; and when the corn and stalks are fed
out, some 90 per cent of the nitrogen will be left in the manure.</p>

<p>“You do not think, then,” said the Doctor, “that nitrogen is such an
important element in manure for corn, as it is in a manure for
wheat.”</p>

<p>I have not said that. If we want a large crop of corn, we shall
usually need a liberal supply of available nitrogen. But this is because
a larger crop of corn means a much larger produce per acre, than a large
crop of wheat. Forty bushels of wheat per acre is an unusually large
crop with us; but 80 bushels of shelled corn can be grown in a favorable
season, and on rich, well-cultivated land. As the Deacon has said, 30
bushels of corn per acre can be grown as easily as 15 bushels of wheat;
and it is quite probable, in many cases, that a manure containing no
nitrogen, might give us a crop of 35 or 40 bushels per acre. In other
words, up to a certain point, manures containing mineral, or
carbonaceous matter, might frequently, in ordinary agriculture, increase
the yield of Indian corn; while on similar land, such manures would have
little effect on wheat.</p>

<p>“That is so,” said the Deacon, “we all know that plaster frequently
increases the growth of corn, while it seldom does much good on
wheat.”</p>

<p>But, after you have got as large a crop as the land will produce,
aided by plaster, ashes, and superphosphate, say 40 bushels of shelled
corn per acre, <i>then</i> if you want to raise 70 bushels per acre, you
must furnish the soil with manures containing sufficient available
nitrogen.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Some years ago, I made some careful experiments with artificial
manures on Indian corn.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the Deacon, “they were made on the south lot,
<span class = "pagenum">278</span>
<a name = "page278" id = "page278"> </a>
in front of my house, and I recollect that the N.Y. State Ag. Society
awarded you a prize of $75 for them.”</p>

<p>“And I recollect,” said I, “how you and some other neighbors laughed
at me for spending so much time in measuring the land and applying the
manures, and measuring the crop. But I wish I could have afforded to
continue them. A&nbsp;single experiment, however carefully made, can not
be depended on. However, I&nbsp;will give the results for what they are
worth, with some remarks made at the time:</p>

<p>“The soil on which the experiments were made, is a light, sandy loam.
It has been under cultivation for upwards of twenty years, and so far as
I can ascertain has never been manured. It has been somewhat
impoverished by the growth of cereal crops, and it was thought that for
this reason, and on account of its light texture and active character,
which would cause the manures to act immediately, it was well adapted
for the purpose of showing the effect of different manurial substances
on the corn-crop.</p>

<p>“The land was clover-sod, two years old, pastured the previous
summer. It was plowed early in the spring, and harrowed until in
excellent condition. The corn was planted May 23, in hills 3½ feet apart
each way.</p>

<p>“The manures were applied in the hill immediately before the seed was
planted.</p>

<p>“With superphosphate of lime, and with plaster (gypsum, or
<i>sulphate of lime</i>), the seed was placed directly on top of the
manure, as it is well known that these manures do not injure the
germinating principle of even the smallest seeds.</p>

<p>“The ashes were dropped in the hill, and then covered with soil, and
the seed planted on the top, so that it should not come in contact with
the ashes.</p>

<p>“Guano and sulphate of ammonia were treated in the same way.</p>

<p>“On the plots where ashes and guano, or ashes and sulphate of ammonia
were both used, the ashes were first put in the hill, and covered with
soil, and the guano or sulphate of ammonia placed on the top, and also
covered with soil before the seed was planted. The ashes and
superphosphate of lime was also treated in the same way. It is well
known that unleached ashes, mixed either with guano, sulphate of
ammonia, or superphosphate, mutually decompose each other, setting free
the ammonia of the guano and sulphate of ammonia, and converting the
soluble phosphate of the superphosphate of lime into the insoluble form
in which it existed before treatment with sulphuric acid. All the plots
were planted on the same day, and the manures weighed and applied under
my

own immediate supervision. Everything was done that was deemed necessary
to secure accuracy.</p>

<p>“The superphosphate of lime was made on purpose for these
experiments, and was a pure mineral manure of superior quality, made
from calcined bones; it cost about 2½ cents per pound. The sulphate of
ammonia was a good, commercial article, obtained from London, at a cost
of about seven cents per pound. The ashes were made from beech and hard
maple (<i>Acer saccharinum</i>) wood, and were sifted through a fine
sieve before being weighed. The guano was the best Peruvian, costing
about three cents per pound. It was crushed and sifted before using. In
sowing the ashes on plot 7, an error occurred in their application, and
for the purpose of checking the result, it was deemed advisable to
repeat the experiment on plot 10.</p>

<p>“On plot 5, with 300 lbs. of superphosphate of lime per acre, the
plants came up first, and <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘exhibted’">exhibited</ins> a healthy, dark-green appearance,
<span class = "pagenum">280</span>
<a name = "page280" id = "page280"> </a>
which they retained for some time. This result was not anticipated,
though it is well known that superphosphate of lime has the effect of
stimulating the germination of turnip-seed, and the early growth of the
plants to an astonishing degree; yet, as it has no such effect on wheat,
it appeared probable that it would not produce this effect on Indian
corn, which, in chemical composition, is very similar to wheat. The
result shows how uncertain are all speculations in regard to the
manurial requirements of plants. This immediate effect of superphosphate
of lime on corn was so marked, that the men (who were, at the time of
planting, somewhat inclined to be skeptical, in regard to the value of
such small doses of manure), declared that ‘superphosphate beats all
creation for corn.’ The difference in favor of superphosphate, at the
time of hoeing, was very perceptible, even at some distance.</p>

<p>“Although every precaution was taken that was deemed necessary, to
prevent the manures from mixing in the hill, or from injuring the seed,
yet, it was found, that those plots dressed with ashes and guano, or
with ashes and sulphate of ammonia, were injured to some extent. Shortly
after the corn was planted, heavy rain set in, and washed the sulphate
of ammonia and guano, down into the ashes, and mutual decomposition took
place, with more or less loss of ammonia. In addition to this loss of
ammonia, these manures came up to the surface of the ground in the form
of an excrescence, so hard that the plants could with difficulty
penetrate through it.</p>

<p>“It will be seen, by examining the table, that although the
superphosphate of lime had a good effect during the early stages of the
growth of the plants, yet the increase of ears of corn in the end did
not come up to these early indications. On plot 5, with 300 lbs. of
superphosphate of lime per acre, the yield is precisely the same as on
plot 2, with 100 lbs. of plaster (<i>sulphate of lime</i>), per acre.
Now, superphosphate of lime is composed necessarily of soluble phosphate
of lime and plaster, or sulphate of lime, formed from a combination of
the sulphuric acid, employed in the manufacture of superphosphate, with
the lime of the bones. In the 300 lbs. of superphosphate of lime, sown
on plot 5, there would be about 100 lbs. of plaster; and as the effect
of this dressing is no greater than was obtained from the 100 lbs. of
plaster, sown on plot 2, it follows, that the good effect of the
superphosphate of lime was due to the plaster that it contained.</p>

<p>“Again, on plot 4, with 150 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia per acre, we
have 90 bushels of ears of sound corn, and 15 bushels of ears of soft
corn, (‘nubbins,’) per acre; or a total increase over the
<span class = "pagenum">281</span>
<a name = "page281" id = "page281"> </a>
plot without manure, of 38 bushels. Now, the sulphate of ammonia
contains no phosphate of lime, and the fact that such a manure gives a
considerable increase of crop, confirms the conclusion we have arrived
at, from a comparison of the results on plots 2 and 5; that the increase
from the superphosphate of lime, is not due to the phosphate of lime
which it contains, unless we are to conclude that the sulphate of
ammonia rendered the phosphate of lime in the soil more readily soluble,
and thus furnished an increased quantity in an available form for
assimilation by the plants&mdash;a conclusion, which the results with
superphosphate alone, on plot 5, and with superphosphate and sulphate of
ammonia, combined, on plot 6, do not sustain.</p>

<p>“On plot 12, half the quantity of sulphate of ammonia, was used as on
plot 4, and the increase is a little more than half what it is where
double the quantity was used. Again, on plot 13, 200 lbs. of Peruvian
guano per acre, gives nearly as great an increase of sound corn, as the
150 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia. Now, 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano
contains nearly as much ammonia as 150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia, and the
increase in both cases is evidently due to the ammonia of these manures.
The 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano, contained about 50 lbs. of phosphate of
lime; but as the sulphate of ammonia, which contains no phosphate of
lime, gives as great an increase as the guano, it follows, that the
phosphate of lime in the guano, had little, if any effect; a&nbsp;result
precisely similar to that obtained with superphosphate of lime.</p>

<p>“We may conclude, therefore, that on this soil, which has never been
manured, and which has been cultivated for many years with the
<i>Ceralia</i>&mdash;or, in other words, with crops which remove a large
quantity of phosphate of lime from the soil&mdash;the phosphate of lime,
relatively to the ammonia, is not deficient. If such was not the case,
an application of soluble phosphate of lime would have given an increase
of crop, which we have shown was not the case in any one of these
experiments.</p>

<p>“Plot 10, with 400 lbs. of unleached wood-ashes per acre, produces
the same quantity of <i>sound corn</i>, with an extra bushel of
‘nubbins’ per acre, as plot 1, without any manure at all; ashes,
therefore, applied alone, may be said to have had no effect whatever. On
plot 3, 400 lbs. of ashes, and 100 lbs. of plaster, give the same total
number of bushels per acre, as plot 2, with 100 lbs. of plaster alone.
Plot 8, with 400 lbs. ashes, and 150 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia, yields
three bushels of sound corn, and five bushels of ‘nubbins’ per acre,
<i>less</i> than plot 4, with 150 lbs. sulphate of
<span class = "pagenum">282</span>
<a name = "page282" id = "page282"> </a>
ammonia alone. This result may be ascribed to the fact previously
alluded to&mdash;the ashes dissipated some of the ammonia.</p>

<p>“Plot 11, with 100 lbs. of plaster, 400 lbs. ashes, 300 lbs. of
superphosphate of lime, and 200 lbs. Peruvian guano (which contains
about as much ammonia as 150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia), produced
precisely the same number of total bushels per acre, as plot 4, with 150
lbs. sulphate of ammonia alone, and but 4 bushels more per acre, than
plot 13, with 200 lbs. Peruvian guano alone. It is evident, from these
results, that neither ashes nor phosphates had much effect on Indian
corn, on this impoverished soil. Plot 14 received the largest dressing
of ammonia (500 lbs. Peruvian guano), and produced much the largest
crop; though the increase is not so great in proportion to the guano, as
where smaller quantities were used.</p>

<p>“The manure which produced the most profitable result, was the 100
lbs. of plaster, on plot 2. The 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano, on plot 13,
and which cost about $6, gave an increase of 14 bushels of shelled corn,
and 6 bushels of ‘nubbins.’ This will pay at the present price of corn
in Rochester, although the profit is not very great. The superphosphate
of lime, although a very superior article, and estimated at cost price,
in no case paid for itself. The same is true of the ashes.</p>

<p>“But the object of the experiment was not so much to ascertain what
manures will pay, but to ascertain, if possible, what constituents of
manures are required, in greatest quantity, for the maximum growth of
corn.<span class = "pad1x"> **</span>Hitherto, no experiments have been
made in this country, on Indian corn, that afforded any certain
information on this point. Indeed, we believe no satisfactory
experiments have been made on Indian corn, in any country, that throw
any definite light on this interesting and important question.
A&nbsp;few years ago, Mr. Lawes made similar experiments to those given
above, on his farm, at Rothamsted, England; but owing to the coolness of
the English climate, the crop did not arrive at maturity.</p>

<p>“Numerous experiments have been made in this country, with guano and
superphosphate of lime; but the superphosphates used were commercial
articles, containing more or less ammonia, and if they are of any
benefit to those crops to which they are applied, it is a matter of
uncertainty whether the beneficial effect of the application is due to
the soluble phosphate of lime, or to the ammonia. On the other hand,
guano contains both ammonia and phosphate; and we are equally at a loss
to determine, whether the effect is attributable to the ammonia or
phosphate, or both. In order, therefore, to determine satisfactorily,
which of the several ingredients
<span class = "pagenum">283</span>
<a name = "page283" id = "page283"> </a>
of plants is required in greatest proportion, for the maximum growth of
any particular crop, we must apply these ingredients separately, or in
such definite compounds, as will enable us to determine to what
particular element or compounds the beneficial effect is to be ascribed.
It was for this reason, that sulphate of ammonia, and a purely mineral
superphosphate of lime, were used in the above experiments. No one would
think of using sulphate of ammonia at its price, [sulphate of ammonia is
now cheaper, while Peruvian guano is more costly and less rich in
ammonia], as an ordinary manure, for the reason, that the same quantity
of ammonia can be obtained in other substances, such as barnyard-manure,
Peruvian guano, etc., at a much cheaper rate. But these manures contain
<i>all</i> the elements of plants, and we can not know whether the
effect produced by them is due to the ammonia, phosphates, or any other
ingredients. For the purpose of experiment, therefore, we must use a
manure that furnishes ammonia without any admixture of phosphates,
potash, soda, lime, magnesia, etc., even though it cost much more than
we could obtain the same amount of ammonia in other manures. I&nbsp;make
these remarks in order to correct a very common opinion, that if
experiments do not <i>pay</i>, they are useless. The ultimate object,
indeed, is to ascertain the most profitable method of manuring; but the
<i>means</i> of obtaining this information, can not in all cases be
profitable.</p>

<p>“Similar experiments to those made on Indian corn, were made on soil
of a similar character, on about an acre of Chinese sugar-cane.
I&nbsp;do not propose to give the results in detail, at this time, and
allude to them merely to mention one very important fact, <i>the
superphosphate of lime had a very marked effect</i>. This manure was
applied in the hill on one plot (the twentieth of an acre,) at the rate
of 400 lbs. per acre, and the plants on this plot came up first, and
outgrew all the others from the start, and ultimately attained the
height of about ten feet; while on the plot receiving no manure, the
plants were not five feet high. This is a result entirely different from
what I should have expected. It has been supposed, from the fact that
superphosphate of lime had no effect on wheat, that it would probably
have little effect on corn, or on the sugar-cane, or other
<i>ceralia</i>; and that, as ammonia is so beneficial for wheat, it
would probably be beneficial for corn and sugar-cane. The above
experiments indicate that such is the case, in regard to Indian corn, so
far as the production of grain is concerned, though, as we have stated,
it is not true in reference to the early growth of the plants. The
superphosphate of lime on Indian corn, stimulated the growth of the
plants, in a very decided manner at first, so
<span class = "pagenum">284</span>
<a name = "page284" id = "page284"> </a>
much so, that we were led to suppose, for some time, that it would give
the largest crop; but at harvest, it was found that it produced no more
corn than plaster. These results seem to indicate, that superphosphate
of lime stimulates the growth of stalks and leaves, and has little
effect in increasing the production of seed. In raising Indian corn, for
fodder or for soiling purposes, superphosphate of lime may be
beneficial, as well as in growing the sorghum for sugar-making purposes,
or for <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘foddder’">fodder</ins>&mdash;though, perhaps, not for seed.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“In addition to the experiments given above, I&nbsp;also made the
same season, on an adjoining field, another set of experiments on Indian
corn, the results of which are given below.</p>

<p>“The land on which these experiments were made, is of a somewhat
firmer texture than that on which the other set of experiments was made.
It is situated about a mile from the barn-yard, and on this account, has
seldom, if ever been manured. It has been cultivated for many years with
ordinary farm crops. It was plowed early in the spring, and it was
harrowed until quite mellow. The corn was planted May 30, 1857. Each
experiment occupied one-tenth of an acre, consisting of 4 rows 3½ feet
apart, and the same distance between the hills in the rows, with one row
without manure between each experimental plot.</p>

<p>“The manure was applied in the hill, in the same manner as in the
first set of experiments.</p>

<p>“The barnyard-manure was well-rotted, and consisted principally of
cow-dung with a little horse-dung. Twenty two-horse wagon loads of this
was applied per acre, and each load would probably weigh about one ton.
It was put in the hill and covered with soil, and the seed then planted
on the top.</p>

“As before stated, the land was of a stronger nature than that on which
the first set of experiments was made, and it was evidently in better
condition, as the plot having no manure produced 20 bushels of ears of
corn per acre more than the plot without manure in the other field.</p>

<p>“On plot 4, 300 lbs. of superphosphate of lime gives a total increase
of 11 bushels of ears of corn per acre over the unmanured plot, agreeing
exactly with the increase obtained from the same quantity of the same
manure on plot 5, in the first set of experiments.</p>

<p>“Plot 3, dressed with 150 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia per acre, gives
a total increase of 28 bushels of ears of corn per acre, over the
unmanured plot; and an increase of 22½ bushels of ears per acre over
plot 2, which received 20 loads of good, well-rotted barnyard-dung per
acre.</p>

<p>“Plot 5, with 400 lbs. of Peruvian guano per acre gives the best crop
of this series viz: an increase of 33 bushels of corn per acre over the
unmanured plot, and 27½ over the plot manured with 20 loads of
barnyard-dung. The 400 lbs. of ‘Cancerine’&mdash;an artificial manure
made in New Jersey from fish&mdash;gives a total increase of 18 bushels
of ears per acre over the unmanured plot, and 12½ bushels more than that
manured with barn-yard dung, though 5 bushels of ears of sound corn and

<h6 class = "section">MANURES FOR TURNIPS.</h6>

<p>To raise a large crop of turnips, especially of <ins class =
"correction" title =
"hyphenation typical for this word">ruta-bagas</ins>, there is nothing better than a liberal
application of rich, well-rotted farm-yard-manure, and 250 to 300 lbs.
of good superphosphate of lime per acre, <i>drilled in with the
seed</i>.</p>

<p>I have seen capital crops of common turnips grown with no other
manure except 300 lbs. of superphosphate per acre, drilled with the
seed. Superphosphate has a wonderful effect on the development of the
roots of the turnip. And this is the secret of its great value for this
crop. It increases the growth of the young plant, developing the
formation of the roots, and when the turnip once gets full possession of
the soil, it appropriates all the plant-food it can find.
A&nbsp;turnip-crop grown with superphosphate, can get from the soil much
more nitrogen than a crop of wheat. The turnip-crop, when supplied with
superphosphate, is a good “scavenger.” It will gather up and organize
into good food the refuse plant-food left in the soil. It is to the
surface soil, what clover is to the subsoil.
<span class = "pagenum">286</span>
<a name = "page286" id = "page286"> </a>
To the market gardener, or to a farmer who manures heavily common
turnips drilled in with superphosphate will prove a valuable crop. On
such land no other manure will be needed. I&nbsp;cannot too earnestly
recommend the use of superphosphate as a manure for turnips.</p>

<p>For Swede turnips or ruta-bagas, it will usually be necessary, in
order to secure a maximum crop, to use a manure which, in addition to
superphosphate, contains available nitrogen. A&nbsp;good dressing of
rich, well-rotted manure, spread on the land, and plowed under, and then
300 lbs. of superphosphate drilled in with the seed, would be likely to
give a good crop.</p>

<p>In the absence of manure, there is probably nothing better for the
ruta-bagas than 300 lbs. of so-called “rectified” Peruvian guano, that
is, guano treated with sulphuric acid, to render the phosphates soluble.
Such a guano is guaranteed to contain 10 per cent of ammonia, and 10 per
cent of soluble phosphoric acid, and would be a good dressing for Swede
turnips.</p>

<p>The best way to use guano for turnips is to sow it broadcast on the
land, and harrow it in, and then either drill in the turnip-seed on the
flat, or on ridges. The latter is decidedly the better plan, provided
you have the necessary implements to do the work expeditiously.
A&nbsp;double mould-board plow will ridge up four acres a day, and the
guano being previously sown on the surface, will be turned up with the
mellow surface-soil into the ridge, where the seed is to be sown. The
young plants get hold of it and grow so rapidly as to be soon out of
danger from the turnip-beetle.</p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURES FOR MANGEL-WURZEL OR SUGAR-BEETS.</h6>

<p>When sugar-beets are grown for feeding to stock, there is probably
little or no difference in the manurial requirements of sugar-beets and
mangel-wurzel. Our object is to get as large a growth as possible
consistent with quality.</p>

<p>“Large roots,” said the Deacon, “have been proved to contain less
nutriment than small roots.”</p>

<p>True, but it does not follow from this that rich land, or heavy
manuring is the chief cause of this difference. It is much more likely
to be due to the variety selected. The seed-growers have been breeding
solely for size and shape. They have succeeded to such an extent that 84
gross tons of roots have been grown on an acre. This is equal to over 94
of our tons per acre. “That is an enormous crop,” said the Deacon; “and
it would require some labor to put 10 acres of them in a cellar.”</p>

<p>“If they were as nutritious as ordinary mangels,” said I, “that
<span class = "pagenum">287</span>
<a name = "page287" id = "page287"> </a>
would be no argument against them. But such is not the case. In a letter
just received from Mr. Lawes, (May, 1878,) he characterizes them as
‘bladders of water and salts.’”</p>

<p>Had the seed-growers bred for <i>quality</i>, the roots would have
been of less size, but they would contain more nutriment.</p>

<p>What we want is a variety that has been bred with reference to
quality; and when this is secured, we need not fear to make the land
rich and otherwise aim to secure great growth and large-sized roots.</p>

<p>It certainly is not good economy to select a variety which has been
bred for years to produce large-sized roots, and then sow this seed on
poor land for the purpose of obtaining small-sized roots. Better take a
variety bred for quality, and then make the land rich enough to produce
a good crop.</p>

<p>We are not likely to err in making the land too rich for
mangel-wurzel or for sugar-beets grown for stock. When sugar-beets are
grown for sugar, we must aim to use manures favorable for the production
of sugar, or rather to avoid using those which are unfavorable. But
where sugar-beets are grown for food, our aim is to get a large amount
of nutriment to the acre. And it is by no means clear to my mind that
there is much to be gained by selecting the sugar-beet instead of a good
variety of mangel-wurzel. It is not a difficult matter, by selecting the
largest roots for seed, and by liberal manuring, and continuously
selecting the largest roots, to convert the sugar-beet into a
mangel-wurzel.</p>

<p>When sugar-beets are grown for food, we may safely manure them as we
would mangel-wurzel, and treat the two crops precisely alike.</p>

<p>I usually raise from ten to fifteen acres of mangel-wurzel every
year. I&nbsp;grow them in rotation with other crops, and not as the Hon.
Harris Lewis and some others do, continuously on the same land. We
manure liberally, but not extravagantly, and get a fair yield, and the
land is left in admirable condition for future crops.</p>

<p>I mean by this, not that the land is specially rich, but that it is
very clean and mellow.</p>

<p>“In 1877,” said the Deacon, “you had potatoes on the land where you
grew mangels the previous year, and had the best crop in the
neighborhood.”</p>

<p>This is true, but still I do not think it a good rotation.
A&nbsp;barley crop seeded with clover would be better, especially if the
mangels were heavily manured. The clover would get the manure which had
been washed into the subsoil, or left in such a condition that potatoes
or grain could not take it up.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">288</span>
<a name = "page288" id = "page288"> </a>
There is one thing in relation to my mangels of 1876 which has escaped
the Deacon. The whole piece was manured and well prepared, and dibbled
in with mangels, the rows being 2½ feet apart, and the seed dropped 15
inches apart in the rows. Owing to poor seed, the mangels failed on
about three acres, and we plowed up the land and drilled in corn for
fodder, in rows 2½ feet apart, and at the rate of over three bushels of
seed per acre. We had a <i>great crop</i> of corn-fodder.</p>

<p>The next year, as I said before, the whole piece was planted with
potatoes, and if it was true that mangels are an “enriching crop,” while
corn is an “exhausting” crop, we ought to have had much better potatoes
after the mangels than after corn. This was certainly not the case; if
there was any difference, it was in favor of the corn. But I do not
place any confidence in an experiment of this kind, where the crops were
not weighed and the results carefully ascertained.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Mr. Lawes has made some most thorough experiments with different
manures on sugar-beets, and in 1876 he commenced a series of experiments
with mangel-wurzel.</p>

<p>The land is a rather stiff clay loam, similar to that on which the
wheat and barley experiments were made. It is better suited to the
growth of beets than of turnips.</p>

<p>“Why so,” asked the Deacon, “I thought that black, bottom land was
best for mangels.”</p>

<p>“Not so, Deacon,” said I, “we can, it is true, grow large crops of
mangels on well-drained and well-manured swampy or bottom land, but the
best soil for mangels, especially in regard to quality, is a good,
stiff, well-worked, and well-manured loam.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the Deacon, “you had a better crop last year on the
lower and blacker portions of the field than on the heavy, clayey
land.”</p>

<p>In one sense, this is true. We had dry weather in the spring, and the
mangel seed on the dry, clayey land did not come up as well as on the
cooler and moister bottom-land. We had more plants to the acre, but the
roots on the clayey land, when they once got fair hold of the soil and
the manure, grew larger and better than on the lighter and moister land.
The great point is to get this heavy land into a fine, mellow
condition.</p>

<p>But to Mr. Lawes’ experiments. They are remarkably interesting and
instructive. But it is not necessary to go into all the details. Suffice
it to say that the experiments seem to prove, very conclusively, that
beets require a liberal supply of available nitrogen.
<span class = "pagenum">289</span>
<a name = "page289" id = "page289"> </a>
Thus, without manure, the yield of beets was about 7½ tons of bulbs per
acre.</p>

<p>With 550 lbs. nitrate of soda per acre, the yield was a little over
22 tons per acre. With 14 tons of farmyard-manure, 18 tons per acre.
With 14 tons of farmyard manure and 550 lbs. nitrate of soda, over 27½
tons per acre.</p>

<p>Superphosphate of lime, sulphates of potash, soda, and magnesia, and
common salt, alone, or with other manures, had comparatively little
effect.</p>

<p>Practically, when we want to grow a good crop of beets or mangels,
these experiments prove that what we need is the richest kind of
barnyard-manure.</p>

<p>If our manure is not rich, then we should use, in addition to the
manure, a&nbsp;dressing of nitrate of soda&mdash;say 400 or 500 lbs. per
acre.</p>

<p>If the land is in pretty good condition, and we have no
barnyard-manure, we may look for a fair crop from a dressing of nitrate
of soda alone.</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Deacon, “that 550 lbs. of nitrate of soda alone,
gave an increase of 14½ tons per acre. And the following year, on the
same land, it gave an increase of 13½ tons; and the next year, on the
same land, over 9 tons.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “the first three years of the experiments (1871-2-3),
550 lbs. of nitrate of soda alone, applied every year, gave an average
yield of 19¼ tons of bulbs per acre. During the same three years, the
plot dressed with 14 tons of barnyard-manure, gave an average yield of
16¼ tons. But now mark. The next year (1874) all the plots were left
without any manure, and the plot which had been previously dressed with
nitrate of soda, alone, fell off to 3 tons per acre, while the plot
which had been previously manured with barnyard-manure, produced 10¾
tons per acre.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said the Deacon, “there is nothing like manure.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURES FOR CABBAGE, PARSNIPS, CARROTS, LETTUCE,
ONIONS, ETC.</h6>

<p>I class these plants together, because, though differing widely in
many respects, they have one feature in common. They are all artificial
productions.</p>

<p>A distinguished amateur horticulturist once said to me, “I&nbsp;do
not see why it is I have so much trouble with lettuce. My land is rich,
and the lettuce grow well, but do not head. They have a tendency to run
up to seed, and soon get tough and bitter.”</p>

<p>I advised him to raise his own seed from the best plants&mdash;and
especially to reject all plants that showed any tendency to go
prematurely
<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
<a name = "page290" id = "page290"> </a>
to seed. Furthermore, I&nbsp;told him I thought if he would sow a little
superphosphate of lime with the seed, it would greatly stimulate the
<i>early</i> growth of the lettuce.</p>

<p>As I have said before, superphosphate, when drilled in with the seed,
has a wonderful effect in developing the root-growth of the young plants
of turnips, and I thought it would have the same effect on lettuce,
cabbage, cauliflowers, etc.</p>

<p>“But,” said he, “it is not <i>roots</i> that I want, but heads.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said I, “you do not want the plants to follow out their
natural disposition and run up to seed. You want to induce them to throw
out a great abundance of tender leaves. In other words, you want them to
‘head.’ Just as in the turnip, you do not want them to run up to seed,
but to produce an unnatural development of ‘bulb.’”</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, Dr. Gilbert threw out the suggestion, that while it
was evident that turnips required a larger proportion of soluble
phosphates in the soil than wheat; while wheat required a larger
proportion of available nitrogen in the soil, than turnips, it was quite
probable, if we were growing turnips <i>for seed</i>, that then, turnips
would require the same kind of manures as wheat.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>We want exceedingly rich land for cabbage, especially for an early
crop. This is not merely because a large crop of cabbage takes a large
amount of plant-food out of the soil, but because the cultivated cabbage
is an artificial plant, that requires its food in a concentrated shape.
In popular language, the plants have to be “forced.”</p>

<p>According to the analyses of Dr. Anderson, the outside leaves of
cabbage, contain, in round numbers, 91 per cent of water; and the heart
leaves, 94½ per cent. In other words, the green leaves contain 3½ per
cent more dry matter than the heart leaves.</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker, who analyzed more recently some “cattle-cabbage,” found
89½ per cent of water in the green leaves, and 83¾ per cent in the heart
and inner leaves&mdash;thus confirming previous analyses, and showing
also that the composition of cabbages varies considerably.</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker found much less water in the cabbage than Dr.
Anderson.</p>

<p>The specimen analyzed by Dr. V., was grown on the farm of the Royal
Ag. College of England, and I infer from some incidental remarks, that
the crop was grown on rather poor land. And it is probably true that a
large crop of cabbage grown on rich land, contains a higher percentage
of water than cabbage grown on poorer
<span class = "pagenum">291</span>
<a name = "page291" id = "page291"> </a>
land. On the poor land, the cabbage would not be likely to head so well
as on the rich land, and the green leaves of cabbage contain more than
half as much again real dry substance as the heart leaves.</p>

<p>The dry matter of the heart leaves, however, contains more actual
nutriment than the dry matter of the green leaves.</p>

<p>It would seem very desirable, therefore, whether we are raising
cabbage for market or for home consumption, to make the land rich enough
to grow good heads. Dr. Vœlcker says, “In ordinary seasons, the average
produce of Swedes on our poorer fields is about 15 tons per acre. On
weighing the produce of an acre of cabbage, grown under similar
circumstances, I&nbsp;found that it amounted to 17½ tons per acre. On
good, well-manured fields, however, we have had a much larger
produce.”</p>

<p>In a report on the “Cultivation of Cabbage, and its comparative Value
for Feeding purposes,” by J.&nbsp;M. M’Laren, of Scotland, the yield of
Swede turnips, was 29¾ tons per acre, and the yield of cabbage, 47¾ tons
per acre.</p>

<p>“It is very evident,” said the Deacon, “that if you grow cabbage you
should make the land rich enough to produce a good crop&mdash;and I take
it that is all you want to show.”</p>

<p>“I want to show,” I replied, “that our market gardeners have reason
for applying such apparently excessive dressings of rich manure to the
cabbage-crop. They find it safer to put far more manure into the land
than the crop can possibly use, rather than run any risk of getting an
inferior crop. An important practical question is, whether they can not
grow some crop or crops after the cabbage, that can profitably take up
the manure left in the soil.”</p>

<p>Prof. E. Wolff, in the last edition of “Praktische Düngerlehre,”
gives the composition of cabbage. For the details of which, see
Appendix, page 345.</p>

<p>From this it appears that 50 tons of cabbage contain 240 lbs. of
nitrogen, and 1,600 lbs. of ash. Included in the ash is 630 lbs. of
potash; 90 lbs. of soda; 310 lbs. of lime; 60 lbs. of magnesia; 140 lbs.
of phosphoric acid; 240 lbs. of sulphuric acid, and 20 lbs. of
silica.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Henderson, in “Gardening for Profit,” advises the application of 75
tons of stable or barn-yard manure per acre, for early cabbage. For late
cabbage, after peas or early potatoes, he says about 10 tons per acre
are used.</p>

<p>Brill, in “Farm Gardening and Seed Growing,” also makes the same
distinction in regard to the quantity of manure used for early
<span class = "pagenum">292</span>
<a name = "page292" id = "page292"> </a>
and late cabbage. He speaks of 70 to 80 tons or more, per acre, of
well-rotted stable-manure as not an unusual or excessive dressing every
year.</p>

<p>Now, according to Wolff’s table, 75 tons of fresh stable-manure, with
straw, contains 820 lbs. of nitrogen; 795 lbs. of potash; 150 lbs. soda;
315 lbs. of lime; 210 lbs. of magnesia; 420 lbs. of phosphoric acid; 105
lbs. sulphuric acid; 2,655 lbs. of silica, and 60 lbs. of chlorine.</p>

<p>“Put the figures side by side,” said the Deacon, “so that we can
compare them.”</p>

<p>Here they are:</p>

<p>“That is rather an interesting table,” said the Doctor. “In the case
of lime, the crop takes about all that this heavy dressing of manure
supplies&mdash;but I suppose the soil is usually capable of furnishing a
considerable quantity.”</p>

<p>“That may be so,” said the Deacon, “but all the authorities on market
gardening speak of the importance of either growing cabbage on land
containing lime, or else of applying lime as a manure. Quinn, who writes
like a sensible man, says in his book, ‘Money in the Garden,’ ‘A
top-dressing of lime every third year, thirty or forty bushels per acre,
spread broadcast, and harrowed in, just before planting, pays
handsomely.’”</p>

<p>Henderson thinks cabbage can only be grown successfully on land
containing abundance of lime. He has used heavy dressings of lime on
land which did not contain shells, and the result was satisfactory for a
time, but he found it too expensive.</p>

<p>Experience seems to show that to grow large crops of perfect cabbage,
the soil must be liberally furnished with manures rich in nitrogen and
phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>In saying this, I do not overlook the fact that cabbage require a
large quantity of potash. I&nbsp;think, however, that when large
quantities of stable or barn-yard manure is used, it will rarely be
found that the soil lacks potash.</p>

<p>What we need to grow a large crop of cabbage, is manure from well-fed
animals. Such manure can rarely be purchased. Now, the difference
between rich manure and ordinary stable or barnyard-manure,
<span class = "pagenum">293</span>
<a name = "page293" id = "page293"> </a>
consists principally in this: The rich manure contains more nitrogen and
phosphoric acid than the ordinary stable-manure&mdash;and it is in a
more available condition.</p>

<p>To convert common manure into rich manure, therefore, we must add
nitrogen and phosphoric acid. In other words, we must use Peruvian
guano, or nitrate of soda and superphosphate, or bone-dust, or some
other substance that will furnish available nitrogen and phosphoric
acid.</p>

<p>Or it may well be, where stable-manure can be bought for $1.00 per
two-horse load, that it will be cheaper to use it in larger quantity
rather than to try to make it rich. In this case, however, we must
endeavor to follow the cabbage by some crop that has the power of taking
up the large quantity of nitrogen and other plant-food that will be left
in the soil.</p>

<p>The cabbage needs a large supply of nitrogen in the soil, but removes
comparatively little of it. We see that when 75 tons of manure is used,
a&nbsp;crop of 50 tons of cabbage takes out of the soil less than 30 per
cent of the nitrogen. And yet, if you plant cabbage on this land, the
next year, without manure, you would get a small crop.</p>

<p>“It cannot be for want of nitrogen,” said the Deacon.</p>

<p>“Yes it can,” said I. “The cabbage, especially the early kinds, must
have in the soil a much larger quantity of available nitrogen than the
plants can use.”</p>

<p>I do not mean by this that a large crop of cabbage could be raised,
year after year, if furnished only with a large supply of available
nitrogen. In such a case, the soil would soon lack the necessary
inorganic ingredients. But, what I mean, is this: Where land has been
heavily manured for some years, we could often raise a good crop of
cabbage by a liberal dressing of available nitrogen, and still more
frequently, if nitrogen and phosphoric acid were both used.</p>

<p>You may use what would be considered an excessive quantity of
ordinary stable-manure, and grow a large crop of cabbage; but still, if
you plant cabbage the next year, without manure of any kind, you will
get a small crop; but dress it with a manure containing the necessary
amount of nitrogen, and you will, so far as the supply of plant-food is
concerned, be likely to get a good crop.</p>

<p>In such circumstances, I think an application of 800 lbs. of nitrate
of soda per acre, costing, say $32, would be likely to afford a very
handsome profit.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>For lettuce, in addition to well prepared rich land, I&nbsp;should
sow
3 lbs. of superphosphate to each square rod, scattered in the rows
<span class = "pagenum">294</span>
<a name = "page294" id = "page294"> </a>
before drilling in the seed. It will favor the formation of fibrous
roots and stimulate the growth of the young plants.</p>

<p>In raising onions from seed, we require an abundance of rich,
well-rotted manure, clean land, and early sowing.</p>

<p>Onions are often raised year after year on the same land. That this
entails a great waste of manure, is highly probable, but it is not an
easy matter to get ordinary farm-land properly prepared for onions. It
needs to be clean and free from stones and rubbish of all kinds, and
when once it is in good condition, it is thought better to continue it
in onions, even though it may entail more or less loss of fertility.</p>

<p>“What do you mean,” asked the Deacon, “by loss of manure?”</p>

<p>“Simply this,” said I. “We use a far greater amount of plant-food in
the shape of manure than is removed by the crop of onions. And yet,
notwithstanding this fact, it is found, as a matter of experience, that
it is absolutely necessary, if we would raise a large and profitable
crop, to manure it every year.”</p>

<p>A few experiments would throw much light on this matter.
I&nbsp;should expect, when land had been heavily dressed every year for
a few years, with stable-manure, and annually sown to onions, that 800
lbs. of sulphate of ammonia, or of nitrate of soda, or 1,200 lbs. of
Peruvian guano would give as good a crop as 25 or 30 tons of manure. Or
perhaps a better plan would be to apply 10 or 15 loads of manure, and
600 lbs. of guano, or 400 lbs. sulphate of ammonia.</p>

<h5>MANURES FOR GARDENS AND ORCHARDS.</h5>

<h6 class = "section">MANURE FOR MARKET-GARDENS.</h6>

<p>The chief dependence of the market gardener must be on the
stable-manure which he can obtain from the city or village. The chief
defect of this manure is that it is not rich enough in available
nitrogen. The active nitrogen exists principally in the urine, and this
in our city stables is largely lost. A&nbsp;ton of fresh, unmixed
horse-dung contains about 9 lbs. of nitrogen. A&nbsp;ton of horse-urine,
31 lbs. But this does not tell the whole story. The nitrogen in the dung
is contained in the crude, undigested portions of the food. It is to a
large extent insoluble and unavailable, while the nitrogen in the urine
is soluble and active.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">295</span>
<a name = "page295" id = "page295"> </a>
The market-gardener, of course, has to take such manure as he can get,
and the only points to be considered are (1), whether he had better
continue to use an excessive quantity of the manure, or (2), to buy
substances rich in available nitrogen, and either mix them with the
manure, or apply them separately to the soil, or (3), whether he can use
this horse-manure as bedding for pigs to be fed on rich nitrogenous
food.</p>

<p>The latter plan I adopt on my own farm, and in this way I get a very
rich and active manure. I&nbsp;get available nitrogen, phosphoric acid,
and potash, at far cheaper rates than they can be purchased in the best
commercial fertilizers.</p>

<p>Pigs void a large amount of urine, and as pigs are ordinarily kept,
much of this liquid is lost for want of sufficient bedding to absorb it.
With the market-gardener or nurseryman, who draws large quantities of
horse-manure from the city, this need not be the case. The necessary
buildings can be constructed at little cost, and the horse-manure can be
used freely. The pigs should be fed on food rich in nitrogen, such as
bran, malt-combs, brewers’ grains, the refuse animal matter from the
slaughter-houses or butchers’ stores, fish scrap, pea or lentil-meal,
palm-nut cake, or such food as will furnish the most nitrogenous food,
other things being equal, at the cheapest rate.</p>

<p>The market-gardener not only requires large quantities of rich
manure, but he wants them to act quickly. The nurseryman who sets out a
block of trees which will occupy the ground for three, four, or five
years, may want a “lasting manure,” but such is not the case with the
gardener who grows crops which he takes off the land in a few months. As
long as he continues to use horse or cow-manure freely, he need not
trouble himself to get a slow or lasting manure. His great aim should be
to make the manure as active and available as possible. And this is
especially the case if he occupies clayey or loamy land. On sandy land
the manure will decompose more rapidly and act quicker.</p>

<p>“There are many facts,” said the Doctor, “that show that an
artificial application of water is equivalent to an application of
manure. It has been shown that market-gardeners find it necessary to
apply a much larger amount of plant-food to the soil than the crops can
take up. This they have to do year after year. And it may well be that,
when a supply of water can be had at slight cost, it will be cheaper to
irrigate the land, or water the plants, rather than to furnish such an
excess of manure, as is now found necessary. Even with ordinary
farm-crops, we know that they feel the effects of drouth far less on
rich land than on poor land. In
<span class = "pagenum">296</span>
<a name = "page296" id = "page296"> </a>
other words, a&nbsp;liberal supply of plant-food enables the crops to
flourish with less water; and, on the other hand, a&nbsp;greater supply
of water will enable the crops to flourish with a less supply of
plant-food. The market-gardeners should look into this question of
irrigation<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURES FOR SEED-GROWING FARMS.</h6>

<p>In growing garden and vegetable seeds, much labor is necessarily
employed per acre, and consequently it is of great importance to produce
a good yield. The best and cleanest land is necessary to start with, and
then manures must be appropriately and freely used.</p>

<p>“But not too freely,” said the Doctor, “for I am told it is quite
possible to have land too rich for seed-growing.”</p>

<p>It is not often that the land is too rich. Still, it may well be that
for some crops too much stable-manure is used. But in nine cases out of
ten, when such manure gives too much growth and too little or too poor
seed, the trouble is in the quality of the manure. It contains too much
carbonaceous matter. In other words, it is so poor in nitrogen and
phosphoric acid, that an excessive quantity has to be used.</p>

<p>The remedy consists in making richer manures and using a less
quantity, or use half the quantity of stable-manure, and apply the
rectified or prepared Peruvian guano, at the rate of 300 lbs. or 400
lbs. per acre, or say 200 lbs. superphosphate and 200 lbs. nitrate of
soda per acre.</p>

<p>Where it is very important to have the seeds ripen early,
a&nbsp;liberal dressing, say 400 lbs. per acre, of superphosphate of
lime, will be likely to prove beneficial.</p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURE FOR PRIVATE GARDENS.</h6>

<p>I once had a small garden in the city, and having no manure,
I&nbsp;depended entirely on thorough cultivation and artificial
fertilizers, such as superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia. It was
cultivated not for profit, but for pleasure, but I never saw a more
productive piece of land. I&nbsp;had in almost every case two crops a
year on the same land, and on some plots three crops. No manure was
used, except the superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia, and coal and
wood ashes from the house.</p>

<p>About 5 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia was sown broadcast to the square
rod, or worked into the soil very thoroughly in the rows where the seed
was to be sown. Superphosphate was applied at the same rate, but instead
of sowing it broadcast, I&nbsp;aimed to get it as near the seed or the
roots of plants as possible.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">297</span>
<a name = "page297" id = "page297"> </a>
Half a teaspoonful of the mixture, consisting of equal parts of
superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia, stirred into a large three
gallon can of water, and sprinkled on to a bed of verbenas, seemed to
have a remarkable effect on the size and brilliancy of the flowers.</p>

<p>Even to this day, although I have a good supply of rich
barnyard-manure, I&nbsp;do not like to be without some good artificial
manure for the garden.</p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURE FOR HOT-BEDS.</h6>

<p>The best manure for hot-beds is horse or sheep-dung that has been
used as bedding for pigs.</p>

<p>When fresh stable-manure is used, great pains should be taken to save
all the urine. In other words, you want the horse-dung thoroughly
saturated with urine.</p>

<p>The heat is produced principally from the carbon in the manure and
straw, but you need active nitrogenous matter to start the fire. And the
richer the manure is in nitrogenous matter, and the more thoroughly this
is distributed through the manure, the more readily will it ferment.
There is also another advantage in having rich manure, or manure well
saturated with urine. You can make the heap more compact. Poor manure
has to be made in a loose heap, or it will not ferment; but such manure
as we are talking about can be trodden down quite firm, and still
ferment rapid enough to give out the necessary heat, and this compact
heap will continue to ferment longer and give out a steadier heat, than
the loose heap of poor manure.</p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURE FOR NURSERYMEN.</h6>

<p>Our successful nurserymen purchase large quantities of stable and
other manures from the cities, drawing it as fast as it is made, and
putting it in piles until wanted. They usually turn the piles once or
twice, and often three times. This favors fermentation, greatly reducing
it in bulk, and rendering the manure much more soluble and active. It
also makes the manure in the heap more uniform in quality.</p>

<p>Messrs. Ellwanger &amp; Barry tell me that they often ferment the
manure that they draw from the stables in the city, and make it so fine
and rich, that they get but one load of rotted manure from three loads
as drawn from the stables. For some crops, they use at least 20 loads of
this rotted manure per acre, and they estimate that each load of this
rotted manure costs at least $5.00.</p>

<p>H. E. Hooker places the cost of manure equally high, but seems
willing to use all he can get, and does not think we can profitably
employ artificial manures as a substitute.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">298</span>
<a name = "page298" id = "page298"> </a>
In this I agree with him. But while I should not expect artificial
manures, when used alone, to prove as cheap or as valuable as
stable-manure at present prices, I&nbsp;think it may well be that a
little nitrate of soda, sulphate of ammonia, and superphosphate of lime,
or dissolved Peruvian guano, might be used as an <i>auxiliary</i> manure
to great advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. H. E. Hooker, once sowed, at my suggestion, some sulphate of
ammonia and superphosphate on part of a block of nursery trees, and he
could not perceive that these manures did any good. Ellwanger &amp;
Barry also tried them, and reported the same negative result. This was
several years ago, and I do not think any similar experiments have been
made since.</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the Deacon, “you used these self same manures on
farm-crops, and they greatly increased the growth.”</p>

<p>“There are several reasons,” said the Doctor, “why these manures may
have failed to produce any marked effect on the nursery trees. In the
first place, there was considerable prejudice against them, and the
nurserymen would hardly feel like relying on these manures alone. They
probably sowed them on land already well manured; and I think they sowed
them too late in the season. I&nbsp;should like to see them fairly
tried.”</p>

<p>So would I. It seems to me that nitrate of soda, and superphosphate,
or dissolved Peruvian guano, could be used with very great advantage and
profit by the nurserymen. Of course, it would hardly be safe to depend
upon them alone. They should be used either in connection with
stable-manure, or on land that had previously been frequently dressed
with stable-manure.</p>


<h6 class = "section">MANURE FOR FRUIT-GROWERS.</h6>

<p>How to keep up the fertility of our apple-orchards, is becoming an
important question, and is attracting considerable attention.</p>

<p>There are two methods generally recommended&mdash;I dare not say
generally practised. The one, is to keep the orchard in bare-fallow; the
other, to keep it in grass, and top-dress with manure, and either eat
the grass off on the land with sheep and pigs, or else mow it
frequently, and let the grass rot on the surface, for mulch and
manure.</p>

<p>“You are speaking now,” said the Deacon, “of bearing apple-orchards.
No one recommends keeping a young orchard in grass. We all know that
young apple trees do far better when the land is occupied with corn,
potatoes, beans, or some other crop, which can be cultivated, than they
do on land occupied with wheat, barley, oats, rye, buckwheat, or grass
and clover. And even with bearing
<span class = "pagenum">299</span>
<a name = "page299" id = "page299"> </a>
peach trees, I&nbsp;have seen a wonderful difference in an orchard, half
of which was cultivated with corn, and the other half sown with wheat.
The trees in the wheat were sickly-looking, and bore a small crop of
inferior fruit, while the trees in the corn, grew vigorously and bore a
fine crop of fruit. And the increased value of the crop of peaches on
the cultivated land was far more than we can ever hope to get from a
crop of wheat.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the Doctor, “the crop of corn on the cultivated half
of the peach-orchard removed far more plant-food from the soil, than the
crop of wheat. And so it is evident that the difference is not due
wholly to the supply of manure in the surface-soil. It may well be that
the cultivation which the corn received favored the decomposition of
organic matter in the soil, and the formation of nitrates, and when the
rain came, it would penetrate deeper into the loose soil than on the
adjoining land occupied with wheat. The rain would carry the nitrogen
down to the roots of the peach trees, and this will account for the dark
green color of the leaves on the cultivated land, and the yellow,
sickly-looking leaves on the trees among the wheat<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>


<h6 class = "section">HEN-MANURE, AND WHAT TO DO WITH IT.</h6>

<p>A bushel of corn fed to a hen would give no more nitrogen, phosphoric
acid, and potash, in the shape of manure, than a bushel of corn fed to a
pig. The manure from the pig, however, taking the urine and solid
excrement together, contain 82 per cent of water, while that from the
hen contains only 56 per cent of water. Moreover, hens pick up worms and
insects, and their food in such case would contain more nitrogen than
the usual food of pigs, and the manure would be correspondingly richer
in nitrogen. Hence it happens that 100 lbs. of <i>dry</i> hen-manure
would usually be richer in nitrogen than 100 lbs. of <i>dry</i>
pig-manure. But feed pigs on peas, and hens on corn, and the dry
pig-manure would be much richer in nitrogen than the dry hen-manure. The
value of the manure, other things being equal, depends on the food and
not on the animal.</p>

<p>Let no man think he is going to make his farm any richer by keeping
hens, ducks, and geese, than he will by keeping sheep, pigs, and
horses.</p>

<p>“Why is it, then,” asked the Deacon, “that hen-dung proves such a
valuable manure. I&nbsp;would rather have a hundred lbs. of hen-dung
than half a ton of barnyard-manure?”</p>

<p>“And I presume you are right,” said I, “but you must recollect that
your hen-manure is kept until it is almost chemically dry. Let

<p>I would, myself, far rather have 100 lbs. of your dry hen-manure than
half a ton of your farmyard-manure. Your hens are fed on richer food
than your cows. The 100 lbs. of hen-manure, too, would act much more
rapidly than the half ton of cow-manure. It would probably do twice as
much good&mdash;possibly three or four times as much good, on the first
crop, as the cow-manure. The nitrogen, being obtained from richer and
more digestible food, is in a much more active and available condition
than the nitrogen in the cow-dung.</p>

<p>“If you go on,” said the Deacon, “I&nbsp;think you will prove that I
am right.”</p>

<p>“I&nbsp;have never doubted,” said I, “the great value of hen-dung, as
compared with barnyard-manure. And all I wish to show is, that,
notwithstanding its acknowledged value, the fact remains that a given
quantity of the same kind of food will give no greater amount of
fertilizing matter when fed to a hen than if fed to a pig.”</p>

<p>I want those farmers who find so much benefit from an application of
hen-manure, ashes, and plaster, to their corn and potatoes, to feel that
if they would keep better cows, sheep, and pigs, and feed them better,
they would get good pay for their feed, and the manure would enable them
to grow larger crops.</p>

<p>While we have been talking, the Deacon was looking over the tables.
(See Appendix.) “I&nbsp;see,” said he, “that wheat and rye contain more
nitrogen than hen-manure, but less potash and phosphoric acid.”</p>

<p>“This is true,” said I, “but the way to compare them, in order to see
the effect of passing the wheat through the hen, is to look at the
composition of the air-dried hen-dung. The fresh hen-dung, according to
the table, contains 56 per cent of water, while wheat contains less than
14½ per cent.”</p>

<p>Let us compare the composition of 1,000 lbs. air-dried hen-dung with
1,000 lbs. of air-dried wheat and rye, and also with bran, malt-combs,
etc.</p>

<p>“That table,” said the Doctor, “is well worth studying. You see, that
when wheat is put through the process of milling, the miller takes out
as much of the starch and gluten as he wants, and leaves you a product
(bran), richer in phosphoric acid, potash, and nitrogen, than you gave
him.”</p>

<p>“And the same is true,” continued the Doctor, “of the hen. You gave
her 2,000 grains of wheat, containing 41.6 grains of nitrogen. She puts
this through the mill, together with some ashes, and bones, that she
picks up, and she takes out all the starch and fat, and nitrogen, and
phosphate of lime, that she needs to sustain life, and to produce flesh,
bones, feathers, and eggs, and leaves you 1,000 grains of manure
containing 32.6 grains of nitrogen, 17.0 grains of potash, and 30.8
grains of phosphoric acid. I&nbsp;do not say,” continued the Doctor,
“that it takes exactly 2,000 grains of wheat to make 1,000 grains of dry
manure. I&nbsp;merely give these figures to enable the Deacon to
understand why 1,000 lbs. of hen-dung is worth more for manure than
1,000 lbs. of wheat.”</p>

<p>“I must admit,” said the Deacon, “that I always have been troubled to
understand why wheat-bran was worth more for manure than the wheat
itself, I&nbsp;see now&mdash;it is because there is less of it. It is
for the same reason that boiled cider is richer than the cider from
which it is made. The cider has lost water, and the bran has lost
starch. What is left is richer in nitrogen, and potash, and phosphoric
acid. And so it is with manure. The animals take out of the food the
starch and fat, and leave the manure richer in nitrogen, phosphoric
acid, and potash.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said I, “Mr. Lawes found by actual experiment, that if you
feed 500 lbs. of barley-meal to a pig, containing 420 lbs. of <i>dry
substance</i>, you get only 70 lbs. of dry substance in the manure. Of
the 420 lbs. of dry substance, 276.2 lbs. are used to support
respiration, etc.; 73.8 lbs. are found in the increase of the pig, and
70 lbs. in the manure.”</p>

<p>The food contains 52 lbs. of nitrogenous matter; the increase of pig
contains 7 lbs., and consequently, if there is no loss, the manure
<span class = "pagenum">302</span>
<a name = "page302" id = "page302"> </a>
should contain 45 lbs. of nitrogenous substance = to 7.14 lbs. of
nitrogen.</p>

<p>“In other words,” said the Doctor, “the 70 lbs. of <i>dry</i> liquid
and solid pig-manure contains 7.14 lbs. of nitrogen, or 100 lbs. would
contain 10.2 lbs. of nitrogen, which is more nitrogen than we now get in
the very best samples of Peruvian guano.”</p>

<p>“And thus it will be seen,” said I, “that though corn-fed pigs,
leaving out the bedding and water, produce a very small quantity of
manure, it is exceedingly rich.”</p>

<p>The table from which these facts were obtained, will be found in the
Appendix&mdash;pages 342-3.</p>

<h5>DIFFERENT KINDS OF MANURE.</h5>

<h6 class = "section">COW-MANURE, AND HOW TO USE IT.</h6>

<p>“It will do more good if fermented,” said a German farmer in the
neighborhood, who is noted for raising good crops of cabbage, “but I
like hog-manure better than cow-dung. The right way is to mix the
hog-manure, cow-dung, and horse-manure together.”</p>

<p>“No doubt about that,” said I, “but when you have a good many cows,
and few other animals, how would you manage the manure?”</p>

<p>“I would gather leaves and swamp-muck, and use them for bedding the
cows and pigs. Leaves make splendid bedding, and they make rich manure,
and the cow-dung and leaves, when made into a pile, will ferment
readily, and make grand manure for&mdash;anything. I&nbsp;only wish I
had all I could use.”</p>

<p>There is no question but what cow-manure is better if fermented, but
it is not always convenient to pile it during the winter in such a way
that it will not freeze. And in this case it may be the better plan to
draw it out on to the land, as opportunity offers.</p>

<p>“I have heard,” said Charley, “that pig-manure was not good for
cabbage, it produces ‘fingers and toes,’ or club-foot.”</p>

<p>Possibly such is the case when there is a predisposition to the
disease, but our German friend says he has never found any ill-effects
from its use.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">303</span>
<a name = "page303" id = "page303"> </a>
“Cows,” said the Doctor, “when giving a large quantity of milk, make
rather poor manure. The manure loses what the milk takes from the
food.”</p>

<p>“We have shown what that loss is,” said I. “It amounts to less than I
think is generally supposed. And in the winter, when the cows are dry,
the manure would be as rich as from oxen, provided both were fed alike.
See Appendix, page 342. It will there be seen that oxen take out only
4.1 lbs. of nitrogen from 100 lbs. of nitrogen consumed in the food. In
other words, provided there is no loss, we should get in the liquid and
solid excrements of the ox and dry cow 95.9 per cent of the nitrogen
furnished in the food, and a still higher per cent of the mineral
matter<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>


<h6 class = "section">SHEEP-MANURE.</h6>

<p>According to Prof. Wolff’s table of analyses, sheep-manure, both
solid and liquid, contain less water than the manure from horses, cows,
or swine. With the exception of swine, the solid dung is also the
richest in nitrogen, while the urine of sheep is pre-eminently rich in
nitrogen and potash.</p>

<p>These facts are in accordance with the general opinions of farmers.
Sheep-manure is considered, next to hen-manure, the most valuable manure
made on the farm.</p>

<p>I do not think we have any satisfactory evidence to prove that 3 tons
of clover-hay and a ton of corn fed to a lot of fattening-sheep will
afford a quantity of manure containing any more plant-food than the same
kind and amount of food fed to a lot of fattening-cattle. The
experiments of Lawes &amp; Gilbert indicate that if there is any
difference it is in favor of the ox. See Appendix, page 343. But it may
well be that it is much easier to save the manure from the sheep than
from the cattle. And so, practically, sheep may be better manure-makers
than cattle&mdash;for the simple reason that less of the urine is
lost.</p>

<p>“As a rule,” said the Doctor, “the dung of sheep contains far less
water than the dung of cattle, though when you slop your breeding ewes
to make them give more milk, the dung differs but little in appearance
from that of cows. Ordinarily, however, sheep-dung is light and dry,
and, like horse-dung, will ferment much more rapidly than cow or
pig-dung. In piling manure in the winter or spring, special pains should
be used to mix the sheep and horse-manure with the cow and pig-manure.
And it may be remarked that for any crop or for any purpose where
stable-manure is deemed desirable, sheep-manure would be a better
substitute than cow or pig-manure.”</p>


<span class = "pagenum">304</span>
<a name = "page304" id = "page304"> </a>
<h6 class = "section">MANURE FROM SWINE.</h6>

<p>The dry matter of hog-manure, especially the urine, is rich in
nitrogen, but it is mixed with such a large quantity of water that a ton
of hog-manure, as it is usually found in the pen, is less valuable than
a ton of horse or sheep-manure, and only a little more valuable than a
ton of cow-manure.</p>

<p>As I have before said, my own plan is to let the store-hogs sleep in
a basement-cellar, and bed them with horse and sheep-manure. I&nbsp;have
this winter over 50 sows under the horse-stable, and the manure from 8
horses keeps them dry and comfortable, and we are not specially lavish
with straw in bedding the horses.</p>

<p>During the summer we aim to keep the hogs out in the pastures and
orchards as much as possible. This is not only good for the health of
the pigs, but saves labor and straw in the management of the manure. It
goes directly to the land. The pigs are good grazers and distribute the
manure as evenly over the land as sheep&mdash;in fact, during hot
weather, sheep are even more inclined to huddle together under the
trees, and by the side of the fence, than pigs. This is particularly the
case with the larger breeds of sheep.</p>

<p>In the winter it is not a difficult matter to save all the liquid and
solid excrements from pigs, provided the pens are dry and no water comes
in from the rain and snow. As pigs are often managed, this is the real
difficulty. Pigs void an enormous quantity of water, especially when fed
on slops from the house, whey, etc. If they are kept in a pen with a
separate feeding and sleeping apartment, both should be under cover, and
the feeding apartment may be kept covered a foot or so thick with the
soiled bedding from the sleeping apartment. When the pigs get up in a
morning, they will go into the feeding apartment, and the liquid will be
discharged on the mass of manure, straw, etc.</p>

<p>“Dried muck,” said the Deacon, “comes in very handy about a pig-pen,
for absorbing the liquid.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “and even dry earth can be used to great advantage,
not merely to absorb the liquid, but to keep the pens sweet and healthy.
The three chief points in saving manure from pigs are: 1, To have the
pens under cover; 2, to keep the feeding apartment or yard covered with
a thick mass of strawy manure and refuse of any kind, and 3, to scatter
plenty of dry earth or dry muck on the floor of the sleeping apartment,
and on top of the manure in the feeding apartment.”</p>

<p>“You feed most of your pigs,” said the Deacon, “out of doors in the
yard, and they sleep in the pens or basement cellars, and it
<span class = "pagenum">305</span>
<a name = "page305" id = "page305"> </a>
seems to me to be a good plan, as they get more fresh air and exercise
than if confined.”</p>

<p>“We do not lose much manure,” said I, “by feeding in the yards. You
let a dozen pigs sleep in a pen all night, and as soon as they hear you
putting the food in the troughs outside, they come to the door of the
pen, and there discharge the liquid and solid excrements on the mass of
manure left there on purpose to receive and absorb them. I&nbsp;am well
aware that as pigs are often managed, we lose at least half the value of
their manure, but there is no necessity for this. A&nbsp;little care and
thought will save nearly the whole of it<ins class = "correction" title

<p>“In buying manure,” said the Deacon, “it makes quite a difference
whether the load is trod down solid or thrown loosely into the box.
A&nbsp;load of fresh horse-manure, when trod down, weighs half as much
again as when thrown in loose.”</p>

<p>“A load of horse-manure,” said Charley, “after it has been used for
bedding pigs, weighs 3,600 lbs., and only 2,300 lbs. when it is thrown
into the pens, and I suppose a ton of the ‘double-worked’ manure is
fully as valuable as a ton of the fresh horse-manure. If so, 15 ‘loads’
of the pig-pen manure is equal to 24 ‘loads’ of the stable-manure.”</p>

<p>“These figures,” said I, “show how necessary it is to look at this
subject in all its aspects. If I was buying manures <i>by weight,</i> I
would much prefer a ton of sheep-manure, if it had been made under
cover, to any other manure except hen-dung, especially if it contained
all the urine from the sheep. But if buying manure by the load or cord,
that from a covered pig-pen would be preferable to any other.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">LIQUID MANURE ON THE FARM.</h6>

<p>I have never had any personal experience in the use of liquid manure
to any crop except grass. At Rothamsted, Mr. Lawes used to draw out the
liquid manure in a water-cart, and distribute it on grass land.</p>

<p>“What we want to know,” said the Deacon, “is whether the liquid from
our barn-yards will pay to draw out. If it will, the proper method of
using it can be left to our ingenuity.”</p>

The drainage from a barn-yard, it will be seen, contains a little more
than half as much nitrogen as cow-dung; and it is probable that the
nitrogen in the liquid is in a much more available condition than that
in the dung. It contains, also, nearly five times as much potash as the
dung. It would seem, therefore, that with proper arrangements for
pumping and distributing, this liquid could be drawn a short distance
with profit.</p>

<p>But whether it will or will not pay to cart away the drainage, it is
obviously to our interest to prevent, as far as possible, any of the
liquid from running to waste.</p>

<p>It is of still greater importance to guard against any loss of urine.
It will be seen that, on the average, a&nbsp;ton of the urine of our
domestic animals contains more than twice as much nitrogen as a ton of
the dung.</p>

<p>Where straw, leaves, swamp-muck, or other absorbent materials are not
sufficiently abundant to prevent any loss of urine, means should be used
to drain it into a tank so located that the liquid can either be pumped
back on to the manure when needed, or drawn away to the land.</p>

<p>“I&nbsp;do not see,” said the Deacon, “why horse and sheep-urine
should contain so much more nitrogen and potash than that from the cow
and pig.”</p>

<p>“The figures given by Prof. Wolff,” said I, “are general averages.
The composition of the urine varies greatly. The richer the food in
digestible nitrogenous matter, the more nitrogen will there be in the
dry matter of the urine. And, other things being equal, the less water
the animal drinks, the richer will the urine be in nitrogen. The urine
from a sheep fed solely on turnips would contain little or no more
nitrogen than the urine of a cow fed on turnips. An ox or a dry cow fed
on grass would probably void no more nor no poorer urine than a horse
fed on grass. The urine that Mr. Lawes drew out in a cart on to his
grass-land was made by sheep that had one lb. each of oil-cake per day,
and one lb. of chaffed clover-hay, and all the turnips they would eat.
They voided a large quantity of urine, but as the food was rich in
nitrogen, the urine was doubtless nearly or quite as rich as that
analyzed by Prof. Wolff, though that probably contained less water<ins
class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p>If I was going to draw out liquid manure, I&nbsp;should be very
careful to spout all the buildings, and keep the animals and manure as
much under cover as possible, and also feed food rich in nitrogen. In
such circumstances, it would doubtless pay to draw the urine full as
well as to draw the solid manure.</p>

<p>One ton of fresh fæces contains more than twice as much nitrogen, and
more than three times as much phosphoric acid, as a ton of fresh mixed
animal-dung. The nitrogen, too, is probably in a more available
condition than that in common barnyard-dung; and we should not be far
wrong in estimating 1 ton of fæces equal to 2½ tons of ordinary dung, or
about equal in value to carefully preserved manure from liberally-fed
sheep, swine, and fattening cattle.</p>

<p>“It is an unpleasant job,” said the Deacon, “but it pays well to
empty the vaults at least twice a year.”</p>

<p>“If farmers,” said the Doctor, “would only throw into the vaults from
time to time some dry earth or coal ashes, the contents of the vaults
could be removed without any disagreeable smell.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said I, “and even where a vault has been shamefully
neglected, and is full of offensive matter, it can be cleaned out
without difficulty and without smell. I&nbsp;have cleaned out a large
vault in an hour. We were drawing manure from the yards with three teams
and piling it in the field. We brought back a load of sand and threw
half of it into the vault, and put the other half on one side, to be
used as required. The sand and fæces were then, with a long-handled
shovel, thrown into the wagon, and drawn to the pile of manure in the
field, and thrown on to the pile, not more than two or three inches
thick. The team brought back a load of sand, and so we continued until
the work was done. Sand or dry earth is cheap, and we used all that was
necessary to prevent the escape of any unpleasant gases, and to keep the
material from adhering to the shovels or the wagon<ins class =

<p>“Human urine,” said the Doctor, “is richer in phosphoric acid,
<span class = "pagenum">309</span>
<a name = "page309" id = "page309"> </a>
but much poorer in nitrogen and potash than the urine from horses, cows,
sheep, and swine.”</p>

<p>“Some years ago,” said the Deacon, “Mr. H.&nbsp;E. Hooker, of
Rochester, used to draw considerable quantities of urine from the city
to his farm. It would pay better to draw out the urine from farm
animals.”</p>

<p>“The figures given above,” said I, “showing the composition of human
excrements, are from Prof. Wolff, and probably are generally correct.
But, of course, the composition of the excrements would vary greatly,
according to the food.”</p>

<p>It has been ascertained by Lawes and Gilbert that the amount of
matter voided by an adult male in the course of a year is&mdash;fæces,
95 lbs.; urine, 1,049 lbs.; total liquid and solid excrements in the
pure state, 1,144 lbs. These contain:</p>

<p>The amount of potash is given by Prof. E. Wolff, not by Lawes and
Gilbert.</p>

<p>The mixed solid and liquid excrements, in the condition they leave
the body, contain about 95 per cent of water. It would require,
therefore, 20 tons of fresh mixed excrements, to make one ton of
<i>dry</i> nightsoil, or the entire amount voided by a mixed family of
43 persons in a year.</p>

<p>One hundred lbs. of fresh fæces contain 75 lbs. of water, and 25 lbs.
of dry substance.</p>

<p>One hundred lbs. of fresh urine contain 96½ lbs. of water, and 3½
lbs. of dry substance.</p>

<p>One hundred lbs. of the dry substance of the fæces contain 5 lbs. of
nitrogen, and 5½ lbs. of phosphates.</p>

<p>One hundred lbs. of the dry substance of the urine contain 27 lbs. of
nitrogen, and 10¾ lbs. of phosphates.</p>

<p>These figures are from Lawes and Gilbert, and may be taken as
representing the composition of excrements from moderately well-fed
persons.</p>

<p>According to Wolff, a ton of fresh human urine contains 12 lbs. of
nitrogen. According to Lawes and Gilbert, 18 lbs.</p>

<p>The liquid carted from the city by Mr. Hooker was from well-fed adult
males, and would doubtless be fully equal to the figures given by Lawes
and Gilbert. If we call the nitrogen worth 20 cents a lb.,
<span class = "pagenum">310</span>
<a name = "page310" id = "page310"> </a>
and the phosphoric acid (soluble) worth 12½ cents, a&nbsp;ton of such
urine would be worth, <i>on the land</i>, $1.06.</p>

<p>“A ton of the fresh fæces,” said the Deacon, “at the same estimate,
would be worth (20&nbsp;lbs. nitrogen, at 20 cents, $4; 21¾ lbs.
phosphoric acid, at 12½ cents, $2.70), $6.70.”</p>

<p>“Not by a good deal,” said the Doctor. “The nitrogen and phosphoric
acid in the urine are both soluble, and would be immediately available.
But the nitrogen and phosphoric acid in the fæces would be mostly
insoluble. We cannot estimate the nitrogen in the fæces at over 15 cents
a lb., and the phosphoric acid at 5 cents. This would make the value of
a ton of fresh fæces, <i>on the land</i>, $4.09.”</p>

<p>“This makes the ton of fæces worth about the same as a ton of urine.
But I would like to know,” said the Deacon, “if you really believe we
could afford to pay $4 per ton for the stuff delivered on the farm?”</p>

<p>“If we could get the genuine article,” said the Doctor, “it would be
worth $4 a ton. But, as a rule, it is mixed with water, and dirt, and
stones, and bricks, and rubbish of all kinds. Still, it is
unquestionably a valuable fertilizer.”</p>

<p>“In the dry-earth closets,” said I, “such a large quantity of earth
has to be used to absorb the liquid, that the material, even if used
several times, is not worth carting any considerable distance. Dr.
Gilbert found that 5 tons of absolutely dry earth, before using,
contained 16.7 lbs. of nitrogen.</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker found that five tons of dry earth gained about 7 lbs. of
nitrogen, and 11 lbs. of phosphoric acid, each time it was used in the
closets. If we consider each lb. of nitrogen with the phosphoric acid
worth 20 cents a lb., 5 tons of the dry earth, after being used once,
would be worth $1.46, or less than 30 cents a ton, and after it had been
used six times, five tons of the material would be worth $11.98, or
about $2.40 per ton.</p>

<p>In this calculation I have not reckoned in the value of the nitrogen
the soil contained before using. Soil, on a farm, is cheap.</p>

<p>It is clear from these facts that any earth-closet manure a farmer
would be likely to purchase in the city has not a very high value. It is
absurd to talk of making “guano” or any concentrated fertilizer out of
the material from earth-closets.</p>

“It is rather a reflection on our science and practical skill,” said the
Doctor, “but it looks at present as though the only plan to adopt in
large cities is to use enormous quantities of water and wash the stuff
into the rivers and oceans for the use of aquatic plants and fishes. The
nitrogen is not all lost. Some of it comes back to us in rains and dews.
Of course, there are places where the sewage of our cities and villages
can be used for irrigating purposes. But when water is used as freely as
it ought to be used for health, the sewage is so extremely poor in
fertilizing matter, that it must be used in enormous quantities, to
furnish a dressing equal to an application of 20 tons of stable-manure
per acre.”</p>

<p>“If,” continued the Doctor, “the sewage is used merely as
<i>water</i> for irrigating purposes, that is another question. The
water itself may often be of great benefit. This aspect of the question
has not received the attention it merits.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">PERUVIAN GUANO.</h6>

<p>Guano is the manure of birds that live principally on fish.</p>

<p>Fish contain a high percentage of nitrogen and phosphoric acid, and
consequently when fish are digested and the carbon is burnt out of them,
the manure that is left contains a still higher percentage of nitrogen
and phosphoric acid than the fish from which it was derived.</p>

<p>Guano is digested fish. If the guano, or the manure from the birds
living on fish, has been preserved without loss, it would contain not
only a far higher percentage of nitrogen, but the nitrogen would be in a
much more available condition, and consequently be more valuable than
the fish from which the guano is made.</p>

<p>The difference in the value of guano is largely due to a difference
in the climate and locality in which it is deposited by the birds. In a
rainless and hot climate, where the bird-droppings would dry rapidly,
little or no putrefaction or fermentation would take place, and there
would be no loss of nitrogen from the formation and escape of
ammonia.</p>

<p>In a damper climate, or where there was more or less rain, the
bird-droppings would putrefy, and the ammonia would be liable to
evaporate, or to be leached out by the rain.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago I saw a quantity of Peruvian guano that contained
more than 18 per cent of nitrogen. It was remarkably light colored. You
know that the white part of hen-droppings consists principally of uric
acid, which contains about 33 per cent of nitrogen.</p>

<p>For many years it was not difficult to find guano containing 13 per
cent of nitrogen, and genuine Peruvian guano was the cheapest
<span class = "pagenum">312</span>
<a name = "page312" id = "page312"> </a>
and best source of available nitrogen. But latterly, not only has the
price been advanced, but the quality of the guano has deteriorated. It
has contained less nitrogen and more phosphoric acid. See the Chapter on
“Value of Fertilizers,” Page 324.</p>


<h6 class = "section">SALTS OF AMMONIA AND NITRATE OF SODA.</h6>

<p>“I wish,” said the Deacon, “you would tell us something about the
‘ammonia-salts’ and nitrate of soda so long used in Lawes and Gilbert’s
experiments. I&nbsp;have never seen any of them.”</p>

<p>“You could not invest a little money to better advantage than to send
for a few bags of sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of soda. You would
then see what they are, and would learn more by using them, than I can
tell you in a month. You use them just as you would common salt. As a
rule, the better plan is to sow them broadcast, and it is important to
distribute them evenly. In sowing common salt, if you drop a handful in
a place, it will kill the plants. And so it is with nitrate of soda or
sulphate of ammonia. Two or three pounds on a square rod will do good,
but if you put half of it on a square yard, it will burn up the crop,
and the other half will be applied in such a small quantity that you
will see but little effect, and will conclude that it is a humbug.
Judging from over thirty years’ experience, I&nbsp;am safe in saying
that not one man in ten can be trusted to sow these manures. They should
be sown with as much care as you sow grass or clover-seed.”</p>

<p>“The best plan,” said the Doctor, “is to mix them with sifted
coal-ashes, or with gypsum, or sifted earth.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” said I, “though there is nothing gained by mixing earth
or ashes with them, except in securing a more even distribution. And if
I was going to sow them myself, I&nbsp;would much prefer sowing them
unmixed. Any man who can sow wheat or barley can sow sulphate of ammonia
or nitrate of soda.”</p>

<p>“Lawes and Gilbert,” said the Deacon, “used sulphate and muriate of
ammonia, and in one or two instances the carbonate of ammonia. Which is
the best?”</p>

<p>“The one that will furnish ammonia or nitrogen at the cheapest rate,”
said the Doctor, “is the best to use. The muriate of ammonia contains
the most ammonia, but the sulphate, in proportion to the ammonia, is
cheaper than the muriate, and far cheaper than the carbonate<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p>Carbonate of ammonia contains 21½ per cent of ammonia.</p>

<p>Sulphate of ammonia contains 25¾ per cent of ammonia = 21⅕ of
nitrogen.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">313</span>
<a name = "page313" id = "page313"> </a>
Muriate of ammonia contains 31 per cent of ammonia = 25½ of
nitrogen.</p>

<p>Nitrate of soda contains 16⅖ per cent of nitrogen.</p>

<p>Nitrate of potash, 13¾ per cent of nitrogen.</p>

<p>From these figures you can ascertain, when you know the price of
each, which is the cheapest source of nitrogen.</p>

<p>“True,” said I, “but it must be understood that these figures
represent the composition of a pure article. The commercial sulphate of
ammonia, and nitrate of soda, would usually contain 10 per cent of
impurities. Lawes and Gilbert, who have certainly had much experience,
and doubtless get the best commercial articles, state that a mixture of
equal parts sulphate and muriate of ammonia contains about 25 per cent
of ammonia. According to the figures given by the Doctor, the mixture
would contain, if pure, over 28 per cent of ammonia. In other words, 90
lbs. of the pure article contains as much as 100 lbs. of the commercial
article.”</p>

<p>As to whether it is better, when you can buy nitrogen at the same
price in nitrate of soda as you can in sulphate of ammonia, to use the
one or the other will depend on circumstances. The nitrogen exists as
nitric acid in the nitrate of soda, and as ammonia in the sulphate of
ammonia. But there are good reasons to believe that before ammonia is
used by the plants it is converted into nitric acid. If, therefore, we
could apply the nitrate just where it is wanted by the growing crop, and
when there is rain enough to thoroughly distribute it through the soil
to the depth of six or eight inches, there can be little doubt that the
nitrate, in proportion to the nitrogen, would have a quicker and better
effect than the sulphate of ammonia.</p>

<p>“There is another point to be considered,” said the Doctor. “Nitric
acid is much more easily washed out of the soil than ammonia. More or
less of the ammonia enters into chemical combination with portions of
the soil, and may be retained for months or years.”</p>

<p>When we use nitrate of soda, we run the risk of losing more or less
of it from leaching, while if we use ammonia, we lose, for the time
being, more or less of it from its becoming locked up in insoluble
combinations in the soil. For spring crops, such as barley or oats, or
spring wheat, or for a meadow or lawn, or for top-dressing winter-wheat
in the spring, the nitrate of soda, provided it is sown early enough, or
at any time in the spring, just previous to a heavy rain, is likely to
produce a better effect than the sulphate of ammonia. But for sowing in
the autumn on winter-wheat the ammonia is to be preferred.</p>

<a name = "page314" id = "page314"> </a>
“Saltpetre, or nitrate of potash,” said the Deacon, “does not contain as
much nitrogen as nitrate of soda.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the Doctor, “if it could be purchased at the same
price, it would be the cheaper manure. It contains 46½ per cent of
potash, and on soils, or for crops where potash is needed, we may
sometimes be able to purchase saltpetre to advantage.”</p>

<p>“If I could come across a lot of damaged saltpetre,” said I, “that
could be got for what it is worth as manure, I&nbsp;should like to try
it on my apple trees&mdash;one row with nitrate of soda, and one row
with nitrate of potash. When we apply manure to apple trees, the
ammonia, phosphoric acid, and potash, are largely retained in the first
few inches of surface soil, and the deeper roots get hold of only those
portions which leach through the upper layer of earth. Nitric acid,
however, is easily washed down into the subsoil, and would soon reach
all the roots of the trees.”</p>

<h5>BONE-DUST AND SUPERPHOSPHATE OF LIME.</h5>

<p>Bone-dust is often spoken of as a phosphatic manure, and it has been
supposed that the astonishing effect bone-dust sometimes produces on old
pasture-land, is due to its furnishing phosphoric acid to the soil.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that bone-dust furnishes nitrogen as well
as phosphoric acid, and we are not warranted in ascribing the good
effect of bones to phosphoric acid alone.</p>

<p>Bones differ considerably in composition. They consist essentially of
gelatine and phosphate of lime. Bones from young animals, and the soft
porous parts of all bones, contain more gelatine than the solid parts,
or the bones from older animals. On the average, 1,000 lbs. of good
commercial bone-dust contains 38 lbs. of nitrogen.</p>

<p>On the old dairy farms of Cheshire, where bone-dust produced such
marked improvement in the quantity and quality of the pastures and
meadows, it was usual to apply from 4,000 to 5,000 lbs. per acre, and
often more. In other words, a&nbsp;dressing of bone-dust
<span class = "pagenum">315</span>
<a name = "page315" id = "page315"> </a>
frequently contained 200 lbs. of nitrogen per acre&mdash;equal to 20 or
25 tons of barn-yard manure.</p>

<p>“It has been supposed,” said the Doctor, “that owing to the removal
of so much phosphoric acid in the cheese sold from the farm, that the
dairy pastures of Cheshire had been exhausted of phosphoric acid, and
that the wonderful benefits following an application of bone-dust to
these pastures, was due to its supplying phosphoric acid.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt,” said I, “the value of phosphoric acid when applied
in connection with nitrogen to old pasture lands, but I contend that the
experience of the Cheshire dairymen with bone-dust is no positive proof
that their soils were particularly deficient in phosphoric acid. There
are many instances given where the gelatine of the bones, alone, proved
of great value to the grass. And I think it will be found that the
Cheshire dairymen do not find as much benefit from superphosphate as
they did from bone-dust. And the reason is, that the latter, in addition
to the phosphoric acid, furnished a liberal dressing of nitrogen.
Furthermore, it is not true that dairying specially robs the soil of
phosphoric acid. Take one of these old dairy farms in Cheshire, where a
dressing of bone-dust, according to a writer in the Journal of the Royal
Agricultural Society, has caused ‘a miserable covering of pink grass,
rushes, and a variety of other noxious weeds, to give place to the most
luxuriant herbage of wild clover, trefoil, and other succulent and
nutritious grasses.’ It is evident from this description of the pastures
before the bones were used, that it would take at least three acres to
keep a cow for a year<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p>“I have known,” says the same writer quoted above, “many a poor,
honest, but half broken-hearted man raised from poverty to comparative
independence, and many a sinking family saved from inevitable ruin by
the help of this wonderful manure.” And this writer not only spoke from
observation and experience, but he showed his faith by his works, for he
tells us that he had paid nearly $50,000 for this manure.</p>

<p>Now, on one of these poor dairy farms, where it required 3 acres to
keep a cow, and where the grass was of poor quality, it is not probable
that the cows produced over 250 lbs. of cheese in a year. One thousand
pounds of cheese contains, on the average, about 45½ lbs. of nitrogen;
2½ lbs. of potash, and 11½ lbs. of phosphoric acid. From this it
follows, if 250 lbs. of cheese are sold annually from three acres of
pasture, less than one lb. of phosphoric acid per acre is exported from
the farm in the cheese.</p>

<p>One ton of timothy-hay contains nearly 14½ lbs. of phosphoric
<span class = "pagenum">316</span>
<a name = "page316" id = "page316"> </a>
acid. And so a farmer who raises a ton of timothy-hay per acre, and
sells it, sends off as much phosphoric acid in one year as such a
Cheshire dairyman as I have alluded to did in fourteen years.</p>

<p>What the dairymen want, and what farmers generally want, is nitrogen
<i>and</i> phosphoric acid. Bone-dust furnishes both, and this was the
reason of its wonderful effects.</p>

<p>It does not follow from this, that bone-dust is the cheapest and best
manure we can use. It is an old and popular manure, and usually commands
a good price. It sells for all it is worth. A&nbsp;dozen years ago,
I&nbsp;bought ten tons of bone-dust at $18 per ton. I&nbsp;have offered
$25 per ton since for a similar lot, but the manufacturers find a market
in New York for all they can make.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Bone-dust, besides nitrogen, contains about 23 per cent of phosphoric
acid.</p>

<p>“That does not give me,” said the Deacon, “any idea of its
value.”</p>

<p>“Let us put it in another shape, then,” said I. “One ton of good
bone-dust contains about as much nitrogen as 8½ tons of fresh
stable-manure, and as much phosphoric acid as 110 tons of fresh
stable-manure. But one ton of manure contains more potash than 5 tons of
bone-dust<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Bone-dust, like barnyard-manure, does not immediately yield up its
nitrogen and phosphoric acid to plants. The bone phosphate of lime is
insoluble in water, and but very slightly soluble in water containing
carbonic acid. The gelatine of the bones would soon decompose in a
moist, porous, warm soil, provided it was not protected by the oil and
by the hard matter of the bones. Steaming, by removing the oil, removes
one of the hindrances to decomposition. Reducing the bones as fine as
possible is another means of increasing their availability.</p>

<p>Another good method of increasing the availability of bone-dust is to
mix it with barnyard-manure, and let both ferment together in a heap.
I&nbsp;am inclined to think this the best, simplest, and most economical
method of rendering bone-dust available. The bone-dust causes the heap
of manure to ferment more readily, and the fermentation of the manure
softens the bones. Both the manure and the bones are improved and
rendered richer and more available by the process.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Another method of increasing the availability of bone-dust is by
mixing it with sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">317</span>
<a name = "page317" id = "page317"> </a>
The phosphate of lime in bones is insoluble in water, though rain water
containing carbonic acid, and the water in soils, slowly dissolve it. By
treating the bones with sulphuric acid, the phosphate of lime is
decomposed and rendered soluble. Consequently, bone-dust treated with
sulphuric acid will act much more rapidly than ordinary bone-dust. The
sulphuric acid does not make it any <i>richer</i> in phosphoric acid or
nitrogen. It simply renders them more available.</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the Doctor, “the use of sulphuric acid for
‘dissolving’ bones, or rather phosphate of lime, introduced a new era in
agriculture. It is the grand agricultural fact of the nineteenth
century.”</p>

<p>“It is perhaps not necessary,” said I, “to give any direction for
treating bones with sulphuric acid. We have got beyond that. We can now
buy superphosphate cheaper than we can make it from bones.”</p>

<p>“But is it as good?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>“Soluble phosphate of lime,” said I, “is soluble phosphate of lime,
and it makes no difference whether it is made from burnt bones, or from
phosphatic guano, or mineral phosphate. That question has been fully
decided by the most satisfactory experiments.”</p>

<p>“Before you and the Deacon discuss that subject,” said the Doctor,
“it would be well to tell Charley what superphosphate is.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me,” said Charley.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Doctor, “phosphate of lime, as it exists in bones,
is composed of three atoms of lime and one atom of phosphoric acid.
Chemists call it the tricalcic phosphate. It is also called the basic
phosphate of lime, and not unfrequently the ‘bone-earth phosphate.’ It
is the ordinary or common form of phosphate of lime, as it exists in
animals, and plants, and in the various forms of mineral phosphates.</p>

<p>“Then there is another phosphate of lime, called the dicalcic
phosphate, or neutral phosphate of lime, or reverted phosphate of lime.
It is composed of one atom of water, two atoms of lime, and one atom of
phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>“Then we have what we call superphosphate, or acid phosphate of lime,
or more properly monocalcic phosphate. It is composed of two atoms of
water, one atom of lime, and one atom of phosphoric acid. This acid
phosphate of lime <i>is soluble in water</i>.</p>

<p>“The manufacture of superphosphate of lime is based on these facts.
The <i>one-lime</i> phosphate is soluble, the <i>three-lime</i>
phosphate is insoluble. To convert the latter into the former, all we
have to do is to <i>take away two atoms of lime</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">318</span>
<a name = "page318" id = "page318"> </a>
“Sulphuric acid has a stronger affinity for lime than phosphoric acid.
And when you mix enough sulphuric acid with finely ground three-lime
phosphate, to take away two atoms of lime, you get the phosphoric acid
united with one atom of lime and two atoms of water.”</p>

<p>“And what,” asked the Deacon, “becomes of the two atoms of lime?”</p>

<p>“They unite with the sulphuric acid,” said the Doctor, “and form
plaster, gypsum, or sulphate of lime.”</p>

<p>“The molecular weight of water,” continued the Doctor, “is 18; of
lime, 56; of sulphuric acid, 80; of phosphoric acid, 142.</p>

<p>“An average sample of commercial bone dust,” continued the Doctor,
“contains about 50 per cent of phosphate of lime. If we take 620 lbs. of
finely-ground bone-dust, containing 310 lbs. of three-lime phosphate,
and mix with it 160 lbs. of sulphuric acid (say 240 lbs. common oil of
vitriol, sp. gr. 1.7), the sulphuric acid will unite with 112 lbs. of
lime, and leave the 142 lbs. of phosphoric acid united with the
remaining 56 lbs. of lime.”</p>

<p>“And that will give you,” said the Deacon, “780 lbs. of ‘dissolved
bones,’ or superphosphate of lime.”</p>

<p>“It will give you more than that,” said the Doctor, “because, as I
said before, the two atoms of lime (112 lbs.) are replaced by two atoms
(36&nbsp;lbs.) of water. And, furthermore, the two atoms of sulphate of
lime produced, contained two atoms (36&nbsp;lbs.) of water. The mixture,
therefore, contains, even when perfectly dry, 72 lbs. of water.”</p>

<p>“Where does this water come from?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>“When I was at Rothamsted,” said I, “the superphosphate which Mr.
Lawes used in his experiments was made on the farm from animal charcoal,
or burnt bones, ground as fine as possible&mdash;the finer the better.
We took 40 lbs. of the meal, and mixed it with 20 lbs. of water, and
then poured on 30 lbs. of common sulphuric acid (sp.&nbsp;g. 1.7), and
stirred it up rapidly and thoroughly, and then threw it out of the
vessel into a heap, on the earth-floor in the barn. Then mixed another
portion, and so on, until we had the desired quantity, say two or three
tons. The last year I was at Rothamsted, we mixed 40 lbs. bone-meal, 30
lbs. water, and 30 lbs. acid; and we thought the additional water
enabled us to mix the acid and meal together easier and better.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Habirshaw tells me,” said the Doctor, “that in making the
‘Rectified Peruvian Guano’ no water is necessary, and none is used. The
water in the guano and in the acid is sufficient to
<span class = "pagenum">319</span>
<a name = "page319" id = "page319"> </a>
furnish the two atoms of water for the phosphate, and the two atoms for
the sulphate of lime.”</p>

<p>“Such is undoubtedly the case,” said I, “and when large quantities of
superphosphate are made, and the mixing is done by machinery, it is not
necessary to use water. The advantage of using water is in the greater
ease of mixing.”</p>

<p>“Bone-dust,” said the Doctor, “contains about 6 per cent of water,
and the sulphuric acid (sp.&nbsp;g. 1.7) contains about one-third its
weight of water. So that, if you take 620 lbs. of bone-dust, and mix
with it 240 lbs. of common sulphuric acid, you have in the mixture 117
lbs. of water, which is 45 lbs. more than is needed to furnish the water
of combination.”</p>

<p>“The superphosphate produced from 620 lbs. of bones, therefore,”
continued the Doctor, “would contain:</p>

<p class = "footnote">* Containing nitrogen, 23½ lbs.</p>

<p>“There is a small quantity of carbonate of lime in the bones,” said
I, “which would take up a little of the acid, and you will have a
remarkably good article if you calculate that the 620 lbs. of bone-dust
furnish you half a ton (1,000 lbs.) of superphosphate. It will be a
better article than it is practically possible to make.”</p>

<p>“Assuming that it made half a ton,” said the Doctor, “it would
contain 14¼ per cent of soluble phosphoric acid, and 2⅓ per cent of
nitrogen.”</p>

<p>“With nitrogen at 20 cents per lb., and soluble phosphoric acid at
12½ c. per lb., this half ton of superphosphate, made from 620 lbs. of
good bone-dust, would be worth $22.50, or $45 per ton.”</p>

<p>“Or, to look at it in another light,” continued the Doctor, “a ton of
bone-dust, made into such a superphosphate as we are talking about,
would be worth $72.58.”</p>

<p>“How much,” asked the Deacon, “would a ton of the bone-dust be
considered worth before it was converted into superphosphate?”</p>

<p>“A ton of bone-dust,” replied the Doctor, “contains 76 lbs. of
nitrogen, worth, at 18 cents per lb., $13.68, and 464 lbs. phosphoric
acid, worth 7 cents per lb., $32.48. In other words, a&nbsp;ton of
bone-dust, at the usual estimate, is worth $46.16.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">320</span>
<a name = "page320" id = "page320"> </a>
“And,” said the Deacon, “after it is converted into superphosphate, the
same ton of bones is worth $72.58. It thus appears that you pay $26.42
per ton for simply making the phosphoric acid in a ton of bones soluble.
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Is’nt’">Isn’t</ins> it
paying a little too much for the whistle?”</p>

<p>“Possibly such is the case,” said I, “and in point of fact,
I&nbsp;think bone-dust, especially from steamed or boiled bones, can be
used with more economy in its natural state than in the form of
superphosphate.”</p>

<p>Superphosphate can be made more economically from mineral phosphates
than from bones&mdash;the nitrogen, if desired, being supplied from
fish-scrap or from some other cheap source of nitrogen.</p>

<p>But for my own use I would prefer to buy a good article of
superphosphate of lime, containing no nitrogen, provided it can be
obtained cheap enough. I&nbsp;would buy the ammoniacal, or nitrogenous
manure separately, and do my own mixing&mdash;unless the mixture could
be bought at a less cost than the same weight of soluble phosphoric
acid, and available nitrogen could be obtained separately.</p>

<p>A pure superphosphate&mdash;and by pure I mean a superphosphate
containing no nitrogen&mdash;can be drilled in with the seed without
injury, but I should be a little afraid of drilling in some of the
ammoniacal or nitrogenous superphosphates with small seeds.</p>

<p>And then, again, the “nitrogen” in a superphosphate mixture may be in
the form of nitric acid, or sulphate of ammonia, in one case, or, in
another case, in the form of hair, woollen rags, hide, or leather. It is
far more valuable as nitric acid or ammonia, because it will act
quicker, and if I wanted hair, woollen rags, horn-shavings, etc.,
I&nbsp;would prefer to have them separate from the superphosphate.</p>

<h5>SPECIAL MANURES.</h5>

<p>Twenty five to thirty years ago, much was said in regard to special
manures. Fertilizers were prepared for the different crops with special
reference to the composition of the plants.</p>

<p>“But it was known then, as now,” said the Doctor, “that all our
agricultural plants were composed of the same elements.”</p>

<p>“True, but what was claimed was this: Some crops contain, for
<span class = "pagenum">321</span>
<a name = "page321" id = "page321"> </a>
instance, more phosphoric acid than other crops, and for these a manure
rich in phosphoric acid was provided. Others contained a large
proportion of potash, and these were called ‘potash crops,’ and the
manure prescribed for them was rich in potash. And so with the other
ingredients of plants.”</p>

<p>“I recollect it well,” said the Doctor, “and, in truth, for several
years I had much faith in the idea. It was advocated with consummate
ability by the lamented Liebig, and in fact a patent was taken out by
the Musgraves, of Liverpool, for the manufacture of Liebig’s Special
Manures, based on this theory. But the manures, though extensively used
by the leading farmers of England, and endorsed by the highest
authorities, did not in the end stand the test of actual farm practice,
and their manufacture was abandoned. And I do not know of any
experienced agricultural chemist who now advocates this doctrine of
special manures.</p>

<p>“Dr. Vœlcker says: ‘The ash-analyses of plants do not afford a
sufficiently trustworthy guide to the practical farmer in selecting the
kind of manure which is best applied to each crop.’”</p>

<p>“Never mind the authorities,” said the Deacon; “what we want are
facts.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the Doctor, “take the wheat and turnip crop as an
illustration.</p>

<p>“We will suppose that there is twice the weight of wheat-straw as of
grain; and that to 10 tons of bulbs there is 3 tons of turnip-tops. Now,
100 lbs. each of the ash of these two crops contain:</p>

<p>“There are other ingredients,” continued the Doctor, “but these are
the most important.</p>

<p>“Now, if you were going to compound a manure for wheat, say 100 lbs.,
consisting of potash and phosphoric acid, what would be the
proportions?”</p>

<p>The Deacon figured for a few moments, and then produced the following
table:</p>

<table summary = "modest table">

<tr>

</table>

<p>“Exactly,” said the Doctor, “and yet the experiments of Lawes
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322" id = "page322"> </a>
and Gilbert clearly prove that a soil needs to be richer in available
phosphoric acid, to produce even a fair crop of turnips, than to produce
a large crop of wheat. And the experience of farmers everywhere tends in
the same direction. England is the greatest turnip-growing country in
the world, and you will find that where one farmer applies potash to
turnips, or superphosphate to wheat, a&nbsp;hundred farmers use
superphosphate as a special manure for the turnip crop.”</p>

<p>“And we are certainly warranted in saying,” continued the Doctor,
“<i>that the composition of a plant affords</i>, in practical
agriculture, and on ordinary cultivated soils, <i>no sort of indication
as to the composition of the manure it is best to apply to the
crop</i>.”</p>

<p>“Again,” continued the Doctor, “if the theory was a correct one, it
would follow that those crops which contained the most nitrogen, would
require the most nitrogen in the manure. Beans, peas, and clover would
require a soil or a manure richer in available nitrogen than wheat,
barley, or oats. We know that the <i>very reverse</i> is true&mdash;know
it from actual, and repeated, and long-continued experiments like those
of Lawes and Gilbert, and from the common experience of farmers
everywhere.”</p>

<p>“You need not get excited,” said the Deacon, “the theory is a very
plausible one, and while I cannot dispute your facts, I&nbsp;must
confess I cannot see <i>why</i> it is not reasonable to suppose that a
plant which contains a large amount of nitrogen should not want a manure
specially rich in nitrogen; or why turnips which contain so much potash
should not want a soil or manure specially rich in potash.”</p>

<p>“Do you recollect,” said I, “that crop of turnips I raised on a poor
blowing-sand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Deacon, “it was the best crop of turnips I ever saw
grow.”</p>

<p>“That crop of turnips,” said I, “was due to a dressing of
superphosphate of lime, with little or no potash in it.”</p>

<p>“I know all that,” said the Deacon. “I&nbsp;admit the fact that
superphosphate is a good manure for turnips. What I want to know is the
reason why superphosphate is better for turnips than for wheat?”</p>

<p>“Many reasons might be given,” said the Doctor; “Prof. Vœlcker
attributes it to the limited feeding range of the roots of turnips, as
compared to wheat. ‘The roots of wheat,’ says Prof. Vœlcker, ‘as is well
known, penetrate the soil to a much greater depth than the more delicate
feeding fibres of the roots of turnips. Wheat, remaining on the ground
two or three months longer than
<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<a name = "page323" id = "page323"> </a>
turnips, can avail itself for a longer period of the resources of the
soil; therefore in most cases the phosphoric acid disseminated through
the soil is amply sufficient to meet the requirements of the wheat crop;
whilst turnips, depending on a thinner depth of soil during their
shorter period of growth, cannot assimilate sufficient phosphoric acid,
to come to perfection<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote invisible">.’</ins> This is, I&nbsp;believe, the main reason why the
direct supply of readily available phosphates is so beneficial to
root-crops, and not to wheat.”</p>

<p>“This reason,” said I, “has never been entirely satisfactory to me.
If the roots of the turnip have such a limited range, how are they able
to get such a large amount of potash?</p>

<p>“It is probable that the turnip, containing such a large relative
amount of potash and so little phosphoric acid, has roots capable of
absorbing potash from a very weak solution, but not so in regard to
phosphoric acid.”</p>

<p>“There is another way of looking at this matter,” said the Doctor.
“You must recollect that, if turnips and wheat were growing in the same
field, both plants get their food from the same solution. And instead of
supposing that the wheat-plant has the power of taking up more
phosphoric acid than the turnip-plant, we may suppose that the turnip
has the power of rejecting or excluding a portion of phosphoric acid. It
takes up no more potash than the wheat-plant, but it takes <i>less</i>
phosphoric acid.”</p>

<p>But it is not necessary to speculate on this matter. For the present
we may accept the fact, that the proportion of potash, phosphoric acid,
and nitrogen in the crop is no indication of the proper proportion in
which these ingredients should be applied to the soil for these crops in
manure.</p>

<p>It may well be that we should use special manures for special crops;
but we must ascertain what these manures should be, not from analyses of
the crops to be grown, but from experiment and experience.</p>

<p>So far as present facts throw light on this subject, we should
conclude that those crops which contain the <i>least</i> nitrogen are
the most likely to be benefited by its artificial application; and the
crops containing the most phosphoric acid, are the crops to which, in
ordinary practical agriculture, it will be unprofitable to apply
superphosphate of lime.</p>

<p>“That,” said the Doctor, “may be stating the case a little too
strong.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” said I, “but you must recollect I am now speaking of
practical agriculture. If I wanted to raise a good crop of cabbage,
I&nbsp;should not think of consulting a chemical analysis
<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<a name = "page324" id = "page324"> </a>
of the cabbage. If I set out cabbage on an acre of land, which, without
manure, would produce 16 tons of cabbage, does any one mean to tell me
that if I put the amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash which
10 tons of cabbage contain, on an adjoining acre, that it would produce
an extra growth of 10 tons of cabbage. I&nbsp;can not believe it. The
facts are all the other way. Plant growth is not such a simple matter as
the advocates of this theory, if there be any at this late day, would
have us believe.”</p>

<h5>VALUE OF FERTILIZERS.</h5>

<p>In 1857, Prof. S.&nbsp;W. Johnson, in his Report to the Connecticut
Agricultural Society, adopted the following valuation:</p>

<table class = "inline" summary = "table presented as part of dialogue">
<tr>
<td>Potash</td>
<td>&nbsp; 4 cents per lb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Phosphoric acid, insoluble in water</td>

<tr>
<td>Phosphoric acid, soluble in water</td>
<td>12½ cents per lb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nitrogen</td>
<td>17 cents per lb.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Analyses of many of the leading commercial fertilizers at that time
showed that, when judged by this standard, the price charged was far
above their actual value. In some cases, manures selling for $60 per
ton, contained nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash worth only from $20
to $25 per ton. And one well-known manure, which sold for $28 per ton,
was found to be worth only $2.33 per ton. A&nbsp;Bone Fertilizer selling
at $50 per ton, was worth less than $14 per ton.</p>

<p>“In 1852,” said the Doctor, “superphosphate of lime was manufactured
by the New Jersey Zinc Co., and sold in New York at $50 per ton of 2,000
lbs. At the same time, superphosphate of lime made from Coprolites, was
selling in England for $24 per ton of 2,240 lbs. The late Prof. Mapes
commenced making “Improved Superphosphate of Lime,” at Newark, N.J., in
1852, and Mr. De Burg, the same year, made a plain superphosphate of
lime in Brooklyn, N.Y. The price, in proportion to value, was high, and,
in fact, the same may be said of many of our superphosphate manures,
until within the last few years<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the comparatively high price, and the uncertain
quality of these commercial manures, the demand has been steadily on the
increase. We have now many honorable and intelligent
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<a name = "page325" id = "page325"> </a>
men engaged in the manufacture and sale of these artificial manures, and
owing to more definite knowledge on the part of the manufacturers and of
the purchasers, it is not a difficult matter to find manures well worth
the money asked for them.</p>

<p>“A correct analysis,” said I, “furnishes the only sure test of value.
‘Testimonials’ from farmers and others are pre-eminently unreliable.
With over thirty years’ experience in the use of these fertilizers,
I&nbsp;would place far more confidence on a good and reliable analysis
than on any actual trial I could make in the field. Testimonials to a
patent fertilizer are about as reliable as testimonials to a
patent-medicine. In buying a manure, we want to know what it contains,
and the condition of the constituents.”</p>

<p>In 1877, Prof. S.&nbsp;W. Johnson gives the following figures,
showing “the trade-values, or cost in market, per pound, of the ordinary
occurring forms of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, as recently
found in the New York and New England markets:</p>

<p>“These ‘estimated values,’” says Prof. Johnson, “are not fixed, but
vary with the state of the market, and are from time to time subject to
revision. They are not exact to the cent or its fractions, because the
same article sells cheaper at commercial or manufacturing centers than
in country towns, cheaper in large lots than in small, cheaper for cash
than on time. These values are high enough to do no injustice to the
dealer, and accurate enough to serve the object of the consumer.</p>

<p>“By multiplying the per cent of Nitrogen, etc., by the trade-value
per pound, and then by 20, we get the value per ton of the several
ingredients, and adding the latter together, we obtain the total
estimated value per ton.</p>

<p>“The uses of the ‘Valuation’ are, 1st, to show whether a given lot or
brand of fertilizer is worth as a commodity of trade what it costs. If
the selling price is no higher than the estimated value,
<span class = "pagenum">326</span>
<a name = "page326" id = "page326"> </a>
the purchaser may he quite sure that the price is reasonable. If the
selling price is but $2 to $3 per ton more than the estimated value, it
may still be a fair price, but if the cost per ton is $5 or more over
the estimated value, it would be well to look further. 2d, Comparisons
of the estimated values, and selling prices of a number of fertilizers
will generally indicate fairly which is the best for the money. But the
‘estimated value’ is not to be too literally construed, for analysis
cannot always decide accurately what is the <i>form</i> of nitrogen,
etc., while the mechanical condition of a fertilizer is an item whose
influence cannot always be rightly expressed or appreciated.</p>

<p>“The <i>Agricultural value</i> of a fertilizer is measured by the
benefit received from its use, and depends upon its fertilizing effect,
or crop-producing power. As a broad general rule it is true that
Peruvian guano, superphosphates, fish-scraps, dried blood, potash salts,
plaster, etc., have a high agricultural value which is related to their
trade-value, and to a degree determines the latter value. But the rule
has many exceptions, and in particular instances the trade-value cannot
always be expected to fix or even to indicate the agricultural value.
Fertilizing effect depends largely upon soil, crop, and weather, and as
these vary from place to place, and from year to year, it cannot be
foretold or estimated except by the results of past experience, and then
only in a general and probable manner.”</p>

<p>“It will be seen,” said the Doctor, “that Prof. Johnson places a
higher value on potash now than he did 20 years ago. He retains the same
figures for soluble phosphoric acid, and makes a very just and proper
discrimination between the different values of different forms of
nitrogen and phosphoric acid.”</p>

<p>“The prices,” said I, “are full as high as farmers can afford to pay.
But there is not much probability that we shall see them permanently
reduced. The tendency is in the other direction. In a public address
Mr.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;B. Lawes has recently remarked: ‘A future generation of
British farmers will doubtless hear with some surprise that, at the
close of the manure season of 1876, there were 40,000 tons of nitrate of
soda in our docks, which could not find purchasers, although the price
did not exceed £12 or £13 per ton.’”</p>

<p>“He evidently thinks,” said the Doctor, “that available nitrogen is
cheaper now than it will be in years to come.”</p>

<p>“Nitrate of soda,” said I, “at the prices named, is only 2½ to 2¾
cents per lb., and the nitrogen it contains would cost less than 18
cents per lb., instead of 24 cents, as given by Prof. Johnson.”</p>

<p>“It is interesting,” said I, “to compare these analyses of Peruvian
guano of to-day, with Peruvian guano brought to England twenty-nine or
thirty years ago. I&nbsp;saw at Rothamsted thirty years ago a bag of
guano that contained 22 per cent of ammonia. And farmers could then buy
guano guaranteed by the dealers (not by the agents of the Peruvian
Government), to contain 16 per cent of ammonia, and 10 per cent of
phosphoric acid. Price, £9 5s. per ton of 2,240 lbs.&mdash;say $40 per

<p>The potash is not given, or this would probably add four or five
dollars to its estimated value.</p>

<p>“All of which goes to show,” said the Deacon, “that the Peruvian
Government is asking, in proportion to value, from two to two and a half
times as much for guano as was charged twenty-five or thirty years ago.
That first cargo of guano, sold in New York under the new guarantee, in
1877, for $56 per ton, is worth no more than the Ichaboe guano sold in
England in 1845, for less than $22 per ton!</p>

<p>“And furthermore,” continued the Deacon, “from all that I can learn,
the guano of the present day is not only far poorer in nitrogen than it
was formerly, but the nitrogen is not as soluble, and consequently not
so valuable, pound for pound. Much of the guano of the present day bears
about the same relation to genuine old-fashioned guano, as leached ashes
do to unleached, or as a ton of manure that has been leached in the
barn-yard does to a ton that has been kept under cover.”</p>

<p>“True, to a certain extent,” said the Doctor, “but you must recollect
that this ‘guaranteed’ guano is now sold by analysis. You pay for what
you get and no more.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said the Deacon, “but what you get is not so good.
A&nbsp;pound of nitrogen in the leached guano is not as available or as
valuable as a pound of nitrogen in the unleached guano. <ins class =
"correction" title = "‘d’ invisible">And</ins> this fact ought to be
understood.”</p>

<p>“One thing,” said I, “seems clear. The Peruvian Government is
charging a considerably higher price for guano, in proportion to its
actual value, than was charged 20 or 25 years ago. It may
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329" id = "page329"> </a>
be, that the guano is still the cheapest manure in the market, but at
any rate the price is higher than formerly&mdash;while there has been no
corresponding advance in the price of produce in the markets of the
world.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">POTASH AS A MANURE.</h6>

<p>On land where fish, fish-scrap, or guano, has been used freely for
some years, and the crops exported from the farm, we may expect a
relative deficiency of potash in the soil. In such a case, an
application of unleached ashes or potash-salts will be likely to produce
a decided benefit.</p>

<p>Clay or loamy land is usually richer in potash than soils of a more
sandy or gravelly character. And on poor sandy land, the use of fish or
of guano, if the crops are all sold, will be soon likely to prove of
little benefit owing to a deficiency of potash in the soil. They may
produce good crops for a few years, but the larger the crops produced
<i>and sold</i>, the more would the soil become deficient in potash.</p>

<p>We have given the particulars of Lawes and Gilbert’s experiments on
barley. Mr. Lawes at a late meeting in London, stated that “he had grown
25 crops of barley one after the other with nitrogen, either as ammonia
or nitrate of soda, but without potash, and that by the use of potash
they had produced practically no better result. This year (1877), for
the first time, the potash had failed a little, and they had now
produced 10 or 12 bushels more per acre with potash than without,
showing that they were coming to the end of the available potash in the
soil. This year (1877), they obtained 54 bushels of barley with potash,
and 42 bushels without it. Of course, this was to be expected, and they
had expected it much sooner. The same with wheat; he expected the end
would come in a few years, but they had now gone on between 30 and 40
years. When the end came they would not be sorry, because then they
would have the knowledge they were seeking for.”</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker, at the same meeting remarked: “Many soils contained from
1½ to 2 per cent of available potash, and a still larger quantity locked
up, in the shape of minerals, which only gradually came into play; but
the quantity of potash carried off in crops did not exceed 2 cwt. per
acre, if so much. Now 0.1 per cent of any constituent, calculated on a
depth of six inches, was equivalent to one ton per acre. Therefore, if a
soil contained only 0.1 per cent of potash, a&nbsp;ton of potash might
be carried off from a
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330" id = "page330"> </a>
depth of 6 inches. But you had not only 0.1 per cent, but something like
1½ per cent and upwards in many soils. It is quite true there were many
soils from which you could not continuously take crops without restoring
the potash.”</p>

<p>“In all of which,” said the Doctor, “there is nothing new. It does
not help us to determine whether potash is or is not deficient in our
soil.”</p>

<p>“That,” said I, “can be ascertained only by actual experiment. Put a
little hen-manure on a row of corn, and on another row a little
hen-manure and ashes, and on another row, ashes alone, and leave one row
without anything. On my farm I am satisfied that we need not buy
potash-salts for manure. I&nbsp;do not say they would do no good, for
they may do good on land not deficient in available potash, just as lime
will do good on land containing large quantities of lime. But potash is
not what my land needs to make it produce maximum crops. It needs
available nitrogen, and possibly soluble phosphoric acid.”</p>

<p>The system of farming adopted in this section, is much more likely to
impoverish the soil of nitrogen and phosphoric acid than of potash.</p>

<p>If a soil is deficient in potash, the crop which will first indicate
the deficiency, will probably be clover, or beans. Farmers who can grow
large crops of red-clover, need not buy potash for manure.</p>

<p>On farms where grain is largely raised and sold, and where the straw,
and corn-stalks, and hay, and the hay from clover-seed are retained on
the farm, and this strawy manure returned to the land, the soil will
become poor from the lack of nitrogen and phosphoric acid long before
there would be any need of an artificial supply of potash.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if farmers should use fish, or guano, or
superphosphate, or nitrate of soda, and sell all the hay, and straw, and
potatoes, and root-crops, they could raise, many of our sandy soils
would soon become poor in available potash. But even in this case the
clover and beans would show the deficiency sooner than wheat or even
potatoes.</p>

<p>“And yet we are told,” said the Deacon, “that potatoes contain no end
of potash.”</p>

<p>“And the same is true,” said I, “of root-crops, such as
mangel-wurzel, turnips, etc., but the fact has no other significance
than this: If you grow potatoes for many years on the same land and
manure them with nitrogenous manures, the soil is likely to be speedily
impoverished of potash.”</p>

<p>“But suppose,” said the Deacon, “that you grow potatoes on the
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<a name = "page331" id = "page331"> </a>
same land without manure of any kind, would not the soil become equally
poor in potash?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “because you would, in such a case, get very small
crops&mdash;small, not from lack of potash, but from lack of nitrogen.
If I had land which had grown corn, potatoes, wheat, oats, and hay, for
many years without manure, or an occasional dressing of our common
barnyard-manure, and wanted it to produce a good crop of potatoes,
I&nbsp;should not expect to get it by simply applying potash. The soil
might be poor in potash, but it is almost certain to be still poorer in
nitrogen and phosphoric acid<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p>Land that has been manured with farm-yard or stable-manure for years,
no matter how it has been cropped, is not likely to need potash. The
manure is richer in potash than in nitrogen and phosphoric acid. And the
same may be said of the soil.</p>

<p>If a farmer uses nitrogenous and phosphatic manures on his clayey or
loamy land that is usually relatively rich in potash, and will apply his
common manure to the sandy parts of the farm, he will rarely need to
purchase manures containing potash.</p>

<h5>RESTORING FERTILITY TO THE SOIL.</h5>

<h6 class = "section">BY SIR J. B. LAWES, BART., LL.D., F.R.S.,
ROTHAMSTED, ENG.</h6>

<p>A relation of mine, who already possessed a very considerable estate,
consisting of light land, about twenty years ago purchased a large
property adjoining it at a very high price. These were days when farmers
were flourishing, and they no more anticipated what was in store for
them in the future, than the inhabitants of the earth in the days of
Noah.</p>

<p>Times have changed since then, and bad seasons, low prices of wheat,
and cattle-disease, have swept off the tenants from these two estates,
so that my relation finds himself now in the position of being the
unhappy owner and occupier of five or six farms, extending over several
thousand acres&mdash;one farm alone occupying an area of two thousand
four hundred acres. Fortunately for the owner, he possesses town
property in addition to his landed estates, so that the question with
him is not, as it is with many land owners, how to find the necessary
capital to cultivate the land, but, having found the capital, how to
expend it in farming, so as to produce a proper return.</p>

<p>It is not very surprising that, under these circumstances, my opinion
should have been asked. What, indeed, would have been the use of a
relation, who not only spent all his time in agricultural experiments,
but also pretended to teach our neighbors how to farm on the other side
of the Atlantic, if he could not bring his science to bear on the land
of an adjoining county! Here is the land&mdash;my relation might
naturally say&mdash;here is the money, and I have so much confidence in
your capacity that I will give you <i>carte-blanche</i> to spend as much
as you please&mdash;what am I to&nbsp;do?</p>

<p>An inspection of the property brought out the following
facts&mdash;that all the land was very light, and that you might walk
over the fresh plowed surface in the wettest weather without any clay
sticking to your boots: still a portion of the soil was dark in color,
and therefore probably contained a sufficient amount of fertility to
make cultivation profitable, provided the management could be conducted
with that care and economy which are absolute essentials in a business
where the expenditure is always pressing closely upon the income.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<a name = "page333" id = "page333"> </a>
Upon land of this description meat-making is the backbone of the system,
which must be adopted, and a large breeding flock of sheep the first
essential towards success.</p>

<p>Science can make very little improvement upon the four-course
rotation&mdash;roots, barley, clover, and wheat, unless, perhaps, it may
be by keeping the land in clover, or mixed grass and clover, for two or
three years.</p>

<p>A good deal of the land I was inspecting was so light, that, in fact,
it was hardly more than sand, and for some years it had been left to
grow anything that came up, undisturbed by the plow.</p>

<p>To a practised eye, the character of the natural vegetation is a sure
indication of the fertility of the soil. Where herds of buffaloes are to
be seen&mdash;their sides shaking with fat&mdash;it is quite evident
that the pastures upon which they feed cannot be very bad; and in the
same way, where a rank growth of weeds is found springing up upon land
that has been abandoned, it may be taken for certain that the elements
of food exist in the soil. This ground was covered with vegetation, but
of the most impoverished description, even the “Quack” or “Couch-grass”
could not form a regular carpet, but grew in small, detached bunches;
everything, in fact, bore evidence of poverty.</p>

<p>Possibly, the first idea which might occur to any one, on seeing land
in this state, might be: Why not grow the crops by the aid of artificial
manures?</p>

<p>Let us look at the question from two points of view: first, in regard
to the cost of the ingredients; and, secondly, in regard to the growth
of the crop.</p>

<p>We will begin with wheat. A crop of wheat, machine-reaped, contains,
as carted to the stack, about six pounds of soil ingredients in every
one hundred pounds; that is to say, each five pounds of mineral matter,
and rather less than one pound of nitrogen, which the plant takes from
the soil, will enable it to obtain ninety-four pounds of other
substances from the atmosphere. To grow a crop of twenty bushels of
grain and two thousand pounds of straw, would require one hundred and
sixty pounds of minerals, and about thirty-two pounds of nitrogen; of
the one hundred and sixty pounds of minerals, one-half would be silica,
of which the soil possesses already more than enough; the remainder,
consisting of about eighty pounds of potash and phosphate, could be
furnished for from three to four dollars, and the thirty-two pounds of
nitrogen could be purchased in nitrate of soda for six or eight dollars.
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<a name = "page334" id = "page334"> </a>
The actual cost of the ingredients, therefore, in the crop of twenty
bushels of wheat, would be about ten to twelve dollars. But as this
manure would furnish the ingredients for the growth of both straw and
grain, and it is customary to return the straw to the land, after the
first crop, fully one-third of the cost of the manure might, in
consequence, be deducted, which would make the ingredients of the twenty
bushels amount to six dollars. Twenty bushels of wheat in England would
sell for twenty-eight dollars; therefore, there would be twenty-two
dollars left for the cost of cultivation and profit.</p>

<p>A French writer on scientific agriculture has employed figures very
similar to the above, to show how French farmers may grow wheat at less
than one dollar per bushel. At this price they might certainly defy the
competition of the United States. It is one thing, however, to grow
crops in a lecture room, and quite another to grow them in a field. In
dealing with artificial manures, furnishing phosphoric acid, potash, and
nitrogen, we have substances which act upon the soil in very different
ways. Phosphate of lime is a very insoluble substance, and requires an
enormous amount of water to dissolve it. Salts of potash, on the other
hand, are very soluble in water, but form very insoluble compounds with
the soil. Salts of ammonia and nitrate of soda are perfectly soluble in
water. When applied to the land, the ammonia of the former substance
forms an insoluble compound with the soil, but in a very short time is
converted into nitrate of lime; and with this salt and nitrate of soda,
remains in solution in the soil water until they are either taken up by
the plant or are washed away into the drains or rivers.</p>

<p>Crops evaporate a very large amount of water, and with this water
they attract the soluble nitrate from all parts of the soil. Very
favorable seasons are therefore those in which the soil is neither too
dry nor too wet; as in one case the solution of nitrate becomes dried up
in the soil, in the other it is either washed away, or the soil remains
so wet that the plant cannot evaporate the water sufficiently to draw up
the nitrates which it contains.</p>

<p>The amount of potash and phosphoric acid dissolved in the water is
far too small to supply the requirements of the plant, and it is
probable that what is required for this purpose is dissolved by some
direct action of the roots of the plant on coming in contact with the
insoluble phosphoric acid and potash in the soil.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<a name = "page335" id = "page335"> </a>
In support of this view, I&nbsp;may mention that we have clear evidence
in some of our experiments of the wheat crop taking up both phosphates
and potash that were applied to the land thirty years ago.</p>

<p>To suppose, therefore, that, if the ingredients which exist in twenty
bushels of wheat and its straw, are simply applied to a barren soil, the
crop will be able to come in contact with, and take up these substances,
is to assume what certainly will not take place.</p>

<p>I have often expressed an opinion that arable land, could not be
cultivated profitably by means of artificial manures, unless the soil
was capable of producing, from its own resources, a&nbsp;considerable
amount of produce; still the question had never up to this time come
before me in a distinct form as one upon which I had to decide one way
or the other. I&nbsp;had, however, no hesitation in coming to the
conclusion, that grain crops could never be grown at a profit upon my
relation’s land, and that consequently, for some years, it would be
better to give up the attempt, and try to improve the pasture.</p>

<p>After what I have said about the insolubility of potash and
phosphoric acid, it may possibly be asked&mdash;why not give a good dose
of these substances at once, as they do not wash out of the
soil&mdash;say enough to grow sixty crops of grain, and apply the
nitrate, or ammonia every year in just sufficient amounts to supply the
wants of the crop?</p>

<p>The objections to this plan are as follows: assuming the most
favorable conditions of climate, and the largest possible produce, the
wheat could certainly not take up the whole of the thirty-two pounds of
nitrogen applied, and the crop which requires nearly one pound of
nitrogen in every one hundred pounds of gross produce, would be
certainly less than three thousand two hundred pounds, if supplied with
only thirty-two pounds of nitrogen. If we take the total produce of the
best and worst wheat crop, grown during the forty years of our
experiments, we shall arrive at a better understanding in the matter.
The following are the figures:</p>

<h5 class = "space smallcaps">Weight of Dry Produce of Wheat Per

<p>In order to ascertain the increase due to the nitrogen of the salts
of ammonia or nitrate of soda, we must deduct from the
<span class = "pagenum">336</span>
<a name = "page336" id = "page336"> </a>
crop the produce obtained, where mineral manures without nitrogen were
used. In 1863 this amount was three thousand pounds, and in 1879 it was
one thousand two hundred pounds. Deducting these amounts from the gross
produce in each case, leaves six thousand three hundred and thirty as
the produce due to the nitrogen in the season of 1863, and two thousand
six hundred and fifty-nine as the produce due to the nitrogen in
1879.</p>

<p>But in each case we applied the same amount of nitrogen, eighty-seven
pounds; and as the amount of nitrogen in a wheat crop, as carted from
the field, contains less than one per cent. of nitrogen, it is evident
that if all that was contained in the manure had been taken up by the
plant, the increased crop should have weighed eight thousand seven
hundred pounds instead of six thousand three hundred and thirty. Thus
even in our best year, some of the nitrogen applied failed to produce
growth; and when we come to the bad year we find that only twenty-six
and a half pounds were taken up out of the eighty-seven pounds applied,
thus leaving more than two-thirds of the whole unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Seasons are only occasionally either very bad or very good. What we
call an average season does not differ very much from the mean of the
best and worst years, which in this case would be represented by a crop
of four thousand four hundred and ninety-four pounds, containing nearly
forty-five pounds of nitrogen. I&nbsp;may say that, although I have
employed one per cent. to avoid fractions in my calculations, strictly
speaking three-quarters of a per cent. would more nearly represent the
real quantity. If, however, on the average, we only obtain about
forty-five pounds from an application of about eighty-seven pounds of
nitrogen, it is evident that not more than one-half of the amount
applied enters into the crop.</p>

<p>Now in dealing with a substance of so costly a nature as ammonia, or
nitrate of soda&mdash;the nitrogen contained in which substances cannot
cost much less than twenty-five cents per pound by the time it is spread
upon the land, it becomes a question of importance to know what becomes
of the other half, or the residue whatever it may be, which has not been
taken up by the crop. Part is undoubtedly taken up by the weeds which
grow with the wheat, and after the wheat has been cut. Part sinks into
the sub-soil and is washed completely away during the winter.</p>

<p>I, myself, am disposed to think that the very great difference
<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<a name = "page337" id = "page337"> </a>
in the size of the Indian corn crops, as compared with the wheat crops
in the States, is partly accounted for by their greater freedom from
weeds, which are large consumers of nitric acid, and, in the case of the
wheat crop, frequently reduce the yield by several bushels per acre. It
must, however, be borne in mind that, though the wheat is robbed of its
food where there are weeds, still if there were no weeds, the amount of
nitric acid which the crop could not get hold of, would, in all
probability, be washed out of the soil during the ensuing winter.
I&nbsp;come to the conclusion, therefore, that the nitrogen alone, which
would be required to produce one bushel of wheat, would cost not much
less than fifty cents; and that, in consequence, wheat-growing by means
of artificial manures, will not pay upon very poor land.</p>

<p>I have said that the land, about which I was consulted, had not been
plowed for several years, and that although nature had done all she
could to clothe the soil with vegetation, the most disheartening feature
in the case was, the poverty of the weeds. A&nbsp;thistle may be a giant
or a dwarf, according to circumstances; here they were all dwarfs. The
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling as in original">plaintain</ins>,
which I believe is sometimes sown in these
districts for food, has a very deep root; here the plants were abundant,
but the leaves were very small and lay so close to the ground, that, as
the manager informed me, “the sheep were often injured from the amount
of sand which they swallowed with the leaves when feeding.”</p>

<p>At Rothamsted, the analyses of the rain water passing through the
ordinary soil of one of my fields, which has been kept free from
vegetation, have shown that the amount of nitric acid liberated in a
soil, and washed out each year, is very large. Taking the ten years
during which these special experiments have been in progress,
I&nbsp;should think that the loss of nitrogen would be equal to, or
possibly exceed, the amount of that substance removed by the average
crops grown in the United States.</p>

<p>The results obtained by the rain gauges, are further completely
confirmed by those in an adjoining field, where wheat and fallow have
been grown alternately for twenty-seven years. The liberation of nitric
acid, during the year of rest, produced for a time a large growth of
wheat, but it was done at a very great waste of the fertility of the
soil, and the produce is now, in proportion, considerably lower than
that grown on the continuously unmanured land.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">338</span>
<a name = "page338" id = "page338"> </a>
These results, if they are to be accepted as correct, must bring about a
very considerable change in the generally received views in regard to
fertility. We not only see more clearly the connection between a former
vegetation and the stored up fertility in our soil, but we also see the
importance of vegetation at the present day, as the only means by which
the loss of nitric acid is prevented. The more completely the land is
covered with vegetation, and the more growth there is, the greater will
be the evaporation of water, and the less will be the loss of nitric
acid by drainage.</p>

<p>I was not at all surprised to find, that the surface soil of a wood
on my farm, was poorer in nitrogen than the soil of an old permanent
pasture, to which no manure had been applied for twenty-five years,
though during the whole period, the crop of hay had been removed every
year from the land. The wood to which I refer is covered with oak,
centuries old, and the foliage is so dense that but little underwood or
other vegetation can grow beneath it. If both the wood and the pasture
were put into arable cultivation, I&nbsp;have no doubt that the pasture
would prove much more fertile than the wood land.</p>

<p>In our experiments on permanent pasture, it has been observed that
the character of the herbage is mainly dependent on the food supplied.
Weeds, and inferior grasses, can hold their own as long as poverty
exists, but with a liberal supply of manure, the superior grasses
overgrow and drive out the bad grasses and weeds. In consequence of the
low price of wheat a good deal of land in England has been laid down to
permanent pasture, and much money has been spent in cleaning the land
preparatory to sowing the grass-seeds. I&nbsp;have on more occasions
than one, suggested that the money employed in this process would be
better expended in manure, by which the weeds would be “improved” off
the face of the land. While walking over the abandoned portion of these
estates I explained my views upon this point to the manager. They were,
however, received with the usual skepticism, and the rejoinder that
“there was only one way of getting rid of the weeds, which was by the
plow and fire.”</p>

<p>There is nothing that speaks to me so forcibly as color in
vegetation; when travelling by rail, I&nbsp;do not require to be told
that such a farm is, or is not, in high condition, or that we are
passing through a fertile or infertile district. There is a peculiar
green color in vegetation which is an unmistakable sign that it is
living upon the fat of the land. I&nbsp;need hardly say
<span class = "pagenum">339</span>
<a name = "page339" id = "page339"> </a>
that, in this case, the color of the vegetation gave unmistakable signs
of the poverty of the soil; but in the midst of the dingy
yellowish-green of the herbage, I&nbsp;came upon one square of bright
green grass. In answer to my enquiry I was told that,
a&nbsp;“lambing-fold had been there last year,” and my informant added
his opinion, “that the manure would be so strong that it would kill
anything!” It had certainly killed the weeds, but in their place, some
good grasses had taken possession of the soil.</p>

<p>The plan I proposed to adopt was, to spend no more money on tillage
operations, but to endeavor to improve the pasture by giving to it the
food necessary to grow good grasses, sowing at the same time a small
quantity of the best seeds. I&nbsp;further suggested that a flock of
sheep should be allowed to run over the whole of the land by day, and be
folded there every night&mdash;about one pound of cotton-seed cake per
head being allowed daily. By this means, as the fold would be moved
every day, the amount of manure deposited on the soil could be
estimated.</p>

<p>If there were a hundred sheep, receiving one pound of decorticated
cotton-seed cake per head, daily, and the hurdles were arranged to
enclose a space of twenty-five by twenty yards, in the course of ten
days an acre of land would have received manure from one thousand pounds
of cake; which amount would supply seventy-seven pounds of nitrogen,
sixty-eight pounds of phosphate of lime, and thirty-two pounds of
potash. This amount of cake would cost about sixteen dollars.</p>

<p>As regards the value of the cake as a food, it is somewhat difficult
to form an estimate; but it takes nine or ten pounds of dry
food&mdash;say roots, cake, and hay&mdash;to produce an increase of one
pound of live weight in sheep. The cake has certainly a higher feeding
value, than either hay or roots, but I will here give it only the same
value, and consider that one hundred and ten pounds of increase of the
animal was obtained by the consumption of the one thousand pounds of
cake. The value of the increase of the live weight would be in England
fully eleven dollars, leaving five dollars as the cost of the manure.
Now the cake furnished seventy-seven pounds of nitrogen alone, which, if
purchased in an artificial manure, would have cost nineteen dollars; and
the other substances supplied by the cake, would have cost from four to
five dollars more. The manures required, therefore, would be obtained
much more cheaply by this than by any other process.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">340</span>
<a name = "page340" id = "page340"> </a>
Labor would be saved by not cultivating the land. Manure would be saved
by substituting vegetation which grows under or above ground, almost all
the year round. And, by feeding the stock with cake, the necessary
fertility would be obtained at the lowest possible cost.</p>

<p>It is probable that the land would require this treatment to be
repeated for several years, before there would be a fair growth of
grass. The land might then be broken up and one grain crop be taken,
then it might again be laid down to grass.</p>

<p>Hitherto, I have considered a case where fertility is almost absent
from the land, this, however, is an exception, as agriculture generally
is carried on upon soils which contain large stores of fertility, though
they may be very unequally distributed. By analysis of the soil we can
measure the total amount of fertility which it contains, but we are left
in ignorance in regard to the amount of the ingredients which are in
such a form that the crops we cultivate can make use of them.</p>

<p>At Rothamsted, among my experiments on the growth of continuous
wheat, at the end of forty years, the soil supplied with salts of
ammonia has yielded, during the whole time, and still continues to
yield, a&nbsp;larger produce than is obtained by a liberal supply of
phosphates and alkaline salts without ammonia.</p>

<p>When we consider that every one hundred pounds of wheat crop, as
carted to the stack, contains about five per cent. of mineral matter,
and one per cent. of nitrogen, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion
that my soil has a large available balance of mineral substances which
the crop could not make use of for want of nitrogen. The crop which has
received these mineral manures now amounts to from twelve to thirteen
bushels per acre, and removes from the land about sixteen pounds of
nitrogen every year.</p>

<p>Analyses of the soil show that, even after the removal of more than
thirty crops in succession, without any application of manure containing
ammonia, the soil still contains some thousands of pounds of nitrogen.
This nitrogen is in combination with carbon; it is very insoluble in
water, and until it becomes separated from the carbon, and enters into
combination with oxygen, does not appear to be of any use to the
crop.</p>

<p>The combination of nitrogen with oxygen, is known as nitric acid. The
nitric acid enters into combination with the lime of the soil, and in
this form becomes the food of plants.</p>

<p>From its great importance in regard to the growth of plants, nitric
acid might be called the main spring of agriculture, but
<span class = "pagenum">341</span>
<a name = "page341" id = "page341"> </a>
being perfectly soluble in water, it is constantly liable to be washed
out of the soil. In the experiment to which I have referred
above&mdash;where wheat is grown by mineral manures alone&mdash;we
estimate that, of the amount of nitric acid liberated each year, not
much more than one-half is taken up by the crop.</p>

<p>The wheat is ripe in July, at which time the land is tolerably free
from weeds; several months, therefore, occur during which there is no
vegetation to take up the nitric acid; and even when the wheat is sown
at the end of October, much nitric acid is liable to be washed away, as
the power of the plant to take up food from the soil is very limited
until the spring.</p>

<p>The formation of nitric acid, from the organic nitrogen in the soil,
is due to the action of a minute plant, and goes on quite independent of
the growth of our crops. We get, however, in the fact an explanation of
the extremely different results obtained by the use of different
manures. One farmer applies lime, or even ground limestone to a soil,
and obtains an increase in his crops; probably he has supplied the very
substance which has enabled the nitrification of the organic nitrogen to
increase; another applies potash, a&nbsp;third phosphates; if either of
these are absent, the crops cannot make use of the nitric acid, however
great may be the amount diffused through the soil.</p>

<p>It may possibly be said that the use of mineral manures tends to
exhaust the soil of its nitrogen; this may, or may not, be true; but
even if the minerals enable the crop to take up a larger amount of the
nitric acid found in the soil year by year, this does not increase the
exhaustion, as the minerals only tend to arrest that which otherwise
might be washed away.</p>

<p>We must look upon the organic nitrogen in the soil, as the main
source of the nitrogen which grows our crops. Whatever may be the amount
derived from the atmosphere, whether in rain, or dew; or from
condensation by the soil, or plants, it is probable that, where the land
is in arable cultivation, the nitrogen so obtained, is less than the
amount washed out of the soil in nitric acid. Upon land which is never
stirred by the plow, there is much less waste and much less
activity.</p>

<p>The large increase in the area of land laid down to permanent pasture
in England, is not due alone to the fall in the price of grain. The
reduction of fertility in many of the soils, which have been long under
the plow, is beginning to be apparent. Under these circumstances a less
exhausting course of treatment becomes necessary, and pasture, with the
production of meat, milk, and butter, takes the place of grain
fields.</p>

<p align = "right">
<span class = "smallcaps">York, Pa.</span>, March 16, 1876.</p>

<p><i>Joseph Harris, Esq., Moreton Farm, Rochester, N.Y.:</i></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Your favor of the 22d
of last month came safely to hand, and I am truly obliged to you for the
reply to my question.&mdash;You ask, can I help you with facts or
suggestions, on the subject of manure? I fear not much; but it may be
useful to you to know what others need to know. I&nbsp;will look forward
to the advent of “Talks on Manures” with much interest, hoping to get
new light on a subject second to none in importance to the farmer.</p>

<p>I have done a little at composting for some years, and am now having
a pile of about forty cords, made up of stable-manure and earth taken
from the wash of higher lands, turned and fined. The labor of digging
and hauling the earth, composting in thin layers with manure, turning,
and fining, is so great, I&nbsp;doubt whether it pays for most farm
crops&mdash;this to be used for mangel-wurzel and market-garden.</p>

<p>The usual plan in this county is to keep the stable-manure made
during winter, and the accumulation of the summer in the barn-yard,
where it is soaked by rain, and trampled fine by cattle, and in August
and September is hauled upon ground to be seeded with wheat and
grass-seeds. I&nbsp;do not think there is much piling and turning
done.</p>

<p>My own conclusions, not based on accurate experiments, however, are,
that the best manure I have ever applied was prepared in a covered pit
on which cattle were allowed to run, and so kept well tramped&mdash;some
drainage into a well, secured by pouring water upon it, when necessary,
and the drainage pumped and distributed over the surface, at short
intervals, particularly the parts not well tramped, and allowed to
remain until it became a homogeneous mass, which it will do without
having undergone so active a fermentation as to have thrown off a
considerable amount of gas.</p>

<p>The next best, composting it with earth, as above described, piled
about five or six feet high, turned as often as convenient, and kept
moist enough to secure fermentation.</p>

<p>Or, to throw all the manure as made into a covered pit, until it is
thoroughly mixed and made fine, by allowing hogs to run upon it and root
at will; and when prepared for even spreading, apply it as a
top-dressing on grass-land&mdash;at any convenient time.</p>

<p>As to how many loads of fresh manure it takes to make one of
well-rotted manure, it may be answered approximately, <i>three to
one</i>, but that would depend a good deal on the manner of doing it,
and the amount of rough material in it. If well trodden by cattle under
cover, and sufficient drainage poured over it, to prevent any violent
fermentation, the
<span class = "pagenum">343</span>
<a name = "page343" id = "page343"> </a>
loss of weight, I&nbsp;think, would not be very great, nor the bulk
lessened over one-half.</p>

<p>Many years ago an old and successful farmer said to me, “if you want
to get the full benefit of manure, spread it as a top-dressing on some
<i>growing crop</i>,” and all my experience and observation since tend
to confirm the correctness of his advice.</p>

<p>While on this subject, allow me to protest against the practice of
naming the quantity of manure applied to a given space, as so many
<i>loads</i>, as altogether too indefinite. The bushel or cord is a
definite quantity, which all can understand.</p>

<p>The average price of good livery stable horse-manure at this place
has been for several years four dollars a cord.</p>

<p>With two and a half miles to haul, I&nbsp;am trying whether keeping a
flock of 50 breeding ewes, and feeding liberally with wheat bran, in
addition to hay and pasture, will not produce the needed manure more
cheaply.</p>

<p align = "center">Respectfully yours,</p>

<p class = "smallcaps" align = "right">Edward Jessop.</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;You ask for the average weight of a cord of manure,
such as we pay four dollars for.</p>

<p>I had a cord of horse-stable manure from a livery stable in York
which had been all the time under cover, with several pigs running upon
it, and was moist, without any excess of wet, loaded into a wagon-box
holding an entire cord, or 128 cubic feet, tramped by the wagoner three
times while loading.</p>

<p>The wagon was weighed at our hay-scales before loading, and then the
wagon and load together, with a net result for the manure of 4,400 lbs.
I&nbsp;considered this manure rather better than the average. I&nbsp;had
another load, from a different place, which weighed over 5,000 lbs., but
on examination it was found to contain a good deal of coal ashes. We
never <i>buy</i> by the ton. Harrison Bros. &amp; Co., Manufacturing
Chemists, Philadelphia, rate barnyard-manure as worth $5.77 per ton, and
say that would be about $7.21 per cord, which would be less than 1½ tons
to the cord. If thrown in loosely, and it happened to be <i>very
dry</i>, that might be possible.</p>

<p>Waring, in his “Handy Book of Husbandry,” page 201, says, he caused a
cord of well-trodden livery stable manure containing the usual
proportion of straw, to be carefully weighed, and that the cord weighed
7,080 lbs.</p>

<p>The load I had weighed, weighing 4,400 lbs., was considered by the
wagoner and by myself as a fair sample of good manure. In view of these
wide differences, further trials would be desirable. Dana, in his “Muck
Manual,” says a cord of green cow-dung, pure, as dropped, weighs 9,289
lbs.</p>

<p>Farmers here seldom draw manure with less than three, more generally
with four horses or mules; loading is done by the purchaser. From the
barn-yard, put on loose boards, from 40 to 60 bushels are about an
average load.</p>

<p>In hauling from town to a distance of three to five miles, farmers
generally make two loads of a cord each, a&nbsp;day’s work. From the
barn-yard,
<span class = "pagenum">344</span>
<a name = "page344" id = "page344"> </a>
a very variable number, per day. In my own case, two men with three
horses have been hauling six and seven loads of sixty bushels, fine
compost, a&nbsp;distance of from one-half to three-fourths of a mile, up
a long and rather steep hill, and spreading from the wagon, as hauled,
upon grass-sod.</p>

<p>Our larger farmers often have one driver and his team, two wagons,
one loading, while the other is drawn to the field; the driver slips off
one of the side-boards, and with his dung-hook draws off piles at nearly
equal distances, to be spread as convenient.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Joseph Harris</i>:</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;If you will refer to
my work “Gardening for Profit,” New Edition, page 34, you will get about
all the information I possess on Manures, except that I do not say
anything about price. In a general way it might be safe to advise that
whenever <i>a ton</i> (it is always best to speak of manures by weight)
of either cow, horse, hog, or other stable-manure can be laid on the
ground for $3, it is cheaper than commercial fertilizers of any kind at
their usual market rates. This $3 per ton, I
<span class = "pagenum">345</span>
<a name = "page345" id = "page345"> </a>
think, would be about the average cost in New York, Boston, or
Philadelphia. We never haul it on the ground until we are ready to plow
it in. If it has to be taken from the hog or cattle yards, we draw it
out into large heaps, convenient to where it is to be put on the land,
turning it, to keep it from burning or “fire-fanging,” if necessary.
None of our farmers or market-gardeners here keep it under cover. The
expense of such covering and the greater difficulties in getting at it,
for the immense quantities we use, would be greater than the benefits to
be derived from keeping it under cover&mdash;benefits, in fact, which,
I&nbsp;think, may be greatly overrated.</p>

FARMER,” TORONTO.</h6>

<p align = "right">
<span class = "smallcaps">“Canada Farmer” Office, Toronto</span>, March
29, 1876.</p>

<p><i>J. Harris, Esq.</i>:</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Yours of the 25th
inst. is to hand, and I shall be most happy to render you any assistance
in my power. The work you undertake is in able hands, and I have every
confidence that, when completed, it will form an invaluable acquisition
to the agricultural literature of the day.</p>

<p>Manure in this city is usually sold by the two-horse load&mdash;about
1½ tons&mdash;at the rate of $1 per load, or 66 cents per ton. The load
contains just about a cord of manure, consequently a cord will weigh
about 1½ tons.</p>

<p>With reference to the general management of manure in Canada,
I&nbsp;may say that the system followed differs in no material respect
from that of New York and the other Eastern States. It is usually kept
over winter in the open barn yard (rarely under cover, I&nbsp;am sorry
to say), laid out on the land about the time of disappearance of last
snow, and plowed in. In some cases it is not carted out until the land
is ready for immediate plowing. With some of our more advanced farmers,
the system has lately been adopted of keeping manure under cover and
sprinkling it thoroughly at intervals with plaster and other substances.
Tanks are also becoming more common than formerly, for the preservation
of liquid manure, which is usually applied by means of large, perforated
hogs-heads, after the manner of street-watering.</p>

<p>You ask, how the manure is managed at Bow Park, Brantford. That made
during fall and winter is carefully kept in as small bulk as possible,
to prevent exposure to the weather. In February and March it is drawn
out and put in heaps 8 feet square, and well packed, to prevent the
escape of ammonia. In spring, as soon as practicable, it is spread, and
plowed under immediately. Manure made in spring and summer is spread on
the field at once, and plowed under with a good, deep furrow.</p>

<p><i>Joseph Harris, Esq.</i>:</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;The great number of

accuracy, yet Mr. Skidmore (who has been testifying voluminously before
the New York Board of Health in relation to manure and street dirt),
assures me that the accompanying figures are nearly correct.
I&nbsp;enclose statement, from two roads, taken from their books, and
the amount shipped over the other road I obtained verbally from the
General Freight Agent, and embody it in the sheet of statistics.</p>

<p>The Ash report I <i>know</i> is correct, as I had access to the books
showing the business, for over ten years. I&nbsp;have made numerous
applications, verbally, and by letter, to our largest market gardeners,
but there seems to exist a general and strong disinclination to
communicate anything worth knowing. I&nbsp;enclose the best of the
replies received. Speaking for some of our largest gardeners, I&nbsp;may
say that they cultivate over one hundred acres, and use land
sufficiently near to the city to enable them to dispense with railroad
transportation in bringing manure to their places and marketing crops.
I&nbsp;have noticed that one of the shrewdest gardeners invariably
composts horn-shavings and bone-meal with horse-manure several months
before expecting to use it. A&nbsp;safe average of manure used per acre
by gardeners, may be stated at ninety (90) tubs, and from two hundred to
twenty hundred pounds of fertilizer in addition, according to its
strength, and the kind of crop.</p>

<p>The following railroad manure statistics will give a generally
correct idea of the age of manure, when used:</p>

<p>Amount of guano used on Long Island, as represented by the books of
Chapman &amp; Vanwyck, and their estimate of sales by other firms, 5,000
tons.</p>

<p>The fertilizers used on the Island are bought almost exclusively by
market gardeners or farmers, who do a little market gardening, as it is
the general conviction that ordinary farm-crops will not give a
compensating return for their application. Most market gardeners keep so
little stock that the manure made on the place is very inconsiderable.
Our dairy farmers either compost home-made manures with that from the
city, spread it on the land for corn in the spring, or rot it separate,
to use in the fall for wheat, on land that has been cropped with oats
the same year. The manure put on for potatoes is generally estimated to
enrich the land sufficient for it to produce one crop of winter grain,
and from five to seven crops of grass, when it is again plowed and
cultivated in rotation with, first, corn, second, potatoes or oats, and
is reseeded in autumn of the same year.</p>

<p>Fish and fish guano are largely used on land bordering the water, and
adjacent to the oil-works. The average price for guano in bulk at
oil-works is $12 per ton. The average price for fish on wharf is $1.50
per thousand, and it is estimated that, as a general average, 6,000 fish
make a ton of guano. The fish, when applied to corn, are placed two at
each hill, and plowed under at any time after the corn is large enough
to cultivate. Seaweed is highly prized by all who use it, and it will
produce a good crop of corn when spread thickly on the land previous to
plowing.</p>

<p><i>Mr. G. H. Rushmore</i>:</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dear Sir.</span>&mdash;Some farmers and
market-gardeners use more, and some less, manure, according to crops to
be raised. I&nbsp;use about 30 good two-horse wagon-loads to the acre,
to be applied in rows or broad-casted, as best for certain crops.
I&nbsp;prefer old horse-dung for most all purposes.

Guano, as a fertilizer, phosphate of bone and blood are very good; they
act as a stimulant on plants and vegetation, and are highly beneficial
to some vegetation&mdash;more valuable on poor soil than elsewhere,
except to produce a thrifty growth in plants, and to insure a large
crop.</p>

<h6>LETTER FROM JOSEPH HEACOCK.</h6>

<p align = "right">
<span class = "smallcaps">Jenkintown</span>, Montgomery Co., Pa., April
18th, 1876.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">My Dear Friend
Harris.</span>&mdash;Stable-manure in Philadelphia, costs by the single
four-horse-load, about $9 or $10. Mostly, the farmers who haul much of
it, have it engaged by the year, and then it can be had for from $7 to
$8 per load. Mostly, four horses are used, though we frequently see two
and three-horse teams, and occasionally, five or six horses are used.
I&nbsp;have never seen any kind of dung hauled but that of horses.
Cow-manure would be thought too heavy to haul so long a distance.
Sugar-house waste, spent hops, glue waste, etc, are hauled to a small
extent. We live about 9 miles from the center of the city, and the road
is very hilly, though otherwise a good one, being made of stone.</p>

<p>The loads vary from 2½ to 3½ or 4 tons for four horses, according to
the dryness of the manure. The wagons are made very strong, and weigh
from 1,600 lbs. to 2,300 or 2,400 lbs., according to the number of
horses that are to be used to them. I&nbsp;cannot say how many cords
there are in an average load, but probably not less than two cords to
four horses. One of my neighbors has a stable engaged by the year. He
pays $2.50 per ton, and averages about three tons per load, and the
distance from the stable in the city to his place, can not be less than
12 miles. His team goes empty one way and of course can not haul more
than a load a day. In fact, can not average that, as it would be too
hard on his horses. The horses used for the purpose are large and
strong. Fifteen or twenty years ago, there was kept on most farms of 75
to 100 acres, a&nbsp;team purposely for hauling manure from the city.
But it is different now, many of the farmers using artificial manures,
as it costs so much less; and others are keeping more stock, and so
making their own manure. Still, there is a great deal hauled yet. And
some of it to a distance of 20 miles. Though when hauled to this
distance, the teams are loaded both ways. For instance, they will start
to the city with a load of hay (35 to 50 cwt.), on Monday afternoon
(Tuesday is the day of the Hay Market); and when they have their load of
hay off on Tuesday, they load their manure and drive out five or six
miles and put up for the night. Next morning they start about 3 o’clock,
arriving home before noon, having been away two days. On Thursday
afternoon, they start again. You can see that manuring in this way is
very expensive. But farmers about here well know that if they do not
manure well they raise
<span class = "pagenum">349</span>
<a name = "page349" id = "page349"> </a>
but little. Probably about four loads are used per acre on the average.
Each load is generally thrown off the wagon in one large heap near where
wanted, and is allowed to lie until they use it. I&nbsp;can not tell how
much it loses in bulk by lying in the heap.</p>

<p>As to what crops it is used on, farmers do not think that they could
go amiss in applying it to anything except oats. But it is probably used
more for top-dressing mowing land, and for potatoes, than for anything
else.</p>

<p>The usual rotation is corn, potatoes, or oats, wheat seeded to clover
and timothy, and then kept in grass from two to four years. Those who
haul stable-manure, usually use bone-dust or superphosphate to a greater
or less extent.</p>

<p>Last December I built a pig-pen, 20 ft.&nbsp;×&nbsp;40 ft., 1½
stories high. The upper story to be used for litter, etc. There is a
four feet entry on the north side, running the length of the building.
The remainder is divided into five pens, each 8 ft.&nbsp;×&nbsp;16 ft.
It is made so that in cold weather it can be closed up tight, while in
warmer weather it can be made as open as an out-shed. I&nbsp;am very
much pleased with it. The pigs make a great deal of manure, and I
believe that it can be made much cheaper than it can be bought and
hauled from Philadelphia.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Middletown</span>, Md., May 11th, 1876.</p>

<p><i>Joseph Harris, Esq.</i>:</p>

<p>I herewith proceed to answer questions asked.</p>

<p>Wheat and corn are principal crops. Corn is fed now altogether to
stock for the manure.</p>

<p>There is but little soiling done. The principal method of making
manure is: Feeding all the corn raised, as well as hay, oats, and roots,
to cattle; using wheat straw, weeds, etc., as bedding, throwing the
manure in the yard (uncovered), and to cover the pile with plaster (by
sowing broadcast), at least once a week. To this pile is added the
manure from the hog-pens, hen-house, etc., and worked over thoroughly at
least twice before using. It is then applied to corn by plowing
<i>under</i>; to wheat, as a top-dressing. For corn it is usually hauled
to the field, thrown off in heaps 25 feet each way, a&nbsp;cart-load
making two heaps. Spread just before the plow. For wheat, spread on
directly after plowing, and thoroughly harrowed in. Applied broadcast
for potatoes. Composts of different kinds are made and used same as in
other localities, I&nbsp;presume. Artificial manures are going into
disrepute (justly too). This is the plan now adopted by the farmers in
this county (Frederick). Where woods are accessible, leaves and mould
are hauled in and added to the manure-heap; in fact, every substance
that can be worked into the manure-heap is freely used. Well-rotted
stable-manure is worth from $1.50 to $2.50 per cord, according to
condition and locality.</p>

AGRICULTURE, KANSAS STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.</h6>

<p align = "right">
<span class = "smallcaps">Kansas State Agricultural College,</span><br>
<span class = "smallcaps">Manhattan</span>, Kansas, May 5, 1876.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dear Sir.</span>&mdash;In reply to your
first question, I&nbsp;would say that stable-manure in this vicinity, is
held in very light estimation. Indeed, by the householders of this city,
and quite generally by the farmers, manure is regarded as one of those
things&mdash;like drouth and grasshoppers&mdash;with which a mysterious
Providence sees fit to clog the operations of the husband-man. The great
bulk of the stable-manure made in this city is, every spring, carted
into ravines and vacant lots&mdash;wherever, in short, with least
expense it can be put out of reach of the senses.</p>

<p>It must not be understood by this that manure has little influence on
the growing crops in Kansas. Nowhere have I seen such excellent results
from application of home-made fertilizers, as in Kansas. For those
sterile wastes known as “Alkali lands,” and “Buffalo wallows,” manure is
a speedy and certain cure. During two years of severe drouth,
I&nbsp;have noticed that wherever manure had been supplied, the crop
withstood the effects of dry weather much better than where no
application had been made. Four years ago, a&nbsp;strip across one of
our fields was heavily manured; this year this field is into wheat, and
a dark band that may be seen half a mile shows where this application
was made.</p>

<p>These facts the better class of our farmers are beginning to
appreciate. A&nbsp;few days ago, a&nbsp;neighbor, a&nbsp;very
intelligent farmer, assured me that from manuring eight to ten acres
every year, his farm was now in better condition than when be broke up
the prairie fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>I know of no analysis of stable or farmyard-manure made in Kansas.
Concerning the <i>weight</i> of manures, I&nbsp;can give you a few
facts, having had occasion during the past winter to weigh several loads
used for experimental purposes. This manure was wheeled into the
barnyard, chiefly from the cattle stalls, during the winter of 1874-5.
It lay in the open yard until February last, when it was weighed and
hauled to the fields. I&nbsp;found that a wagon-box,
1½&nbsp;×&nbsp;3&nbsp;×&nbsp;9 feet, into which the manure was pitched,
without treading, held with slight variations, when level full, one ton.
At this rate a cord would weigh very close to three tons.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty that we have to encounter in the management
of manure grows out of our dry summers. During our summer months, unless
sufficient moisture is obtained, the manure dries out rapidly, becomes
fire-fanged and practically worthless. My practice upon the College farm
has been to give the bottom of the barn-yard a “dishing” form, so that
it holds all the water that falls upon it. The manure I keep as flat as
possible, taking pains to place it where the animals will keep it trod
down solid. I&nbsp;have adopted this plan after having tried composting
and piling the manure in the yards, and am satisfied that it is the only
<i>practical</i> way to manage manures in this climate.</p>

<p>There is no particular crop to which manure is generally applied
<span class = "pagenum">351</span>
<a name = "page351" id = "page351"> </a>
in this State, unless, perhaps, wheat. The practice of applying manure
as a top-dressing to winter-wheat, is rapidly gaining ground here. It is
found that the manure thus applied, acting as a mulch, mitigates the
effects of drouth, besides improving the quality of the grain.</p>

<p><i>Joseph Harris, Esq., Rochester, N.Y.</i>:</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">My Dear Sir.</span>&mdash;I have made
inquiries relating to “the price of stable-manure in New Haven, and how
far the farmers and gardeners haul it, etc.” I have not been to the
horse-car stables, but I have to several <i>livery</i> stables, and they
are all essentially the same.</p>

<p>They say that but little is sold by the <i>cord</i> or <i>ton</i>, or
by any weight or measure. It is sold either “in the lump,” “by the
month,” “by the year,” or “per horse.” Some sell it at a given sum per
month for all their horses, on a general estimate of their
horses&mdash;thus, one man says, “I&nbsp;get, this year, $25 per month
for all my manure, he to remove it as fast as it accumulates; say one,
two, or three times per week. He hauls it about five miles and composts
it all before using.”</p>

<p>Another says, he sells <i>per horse</i>. “I&nbsp;get, this year, $13
per horse, they to haul it.” The price per horse ranges from $10 to $15
per year, the latter sum being high.</p>

<p>From the small or private stables, the manure is generally “lumped”
by private contract, and is largely used about the city. It is hauled
sometimes as much as 10 miles, but usually much less.</p>

<p>But the larger stables often sell per shipment&mdash;it is sent by
cars up the Connecticut Valley to Westfield, etc., where it is often
hauled several miles from the railroad or river.</p>

<p>Much manure is sent by boat from New York to the Connecticut Valley
tobacco lands. Boats (“barges”) are even loaded in Albany, go down the
Hudson, up the Sound to Connecticut, to various places near Hartford,
I&nbsp;am told. Two or three years ago, a&nbsp;man came here and
exhibited to us pressed masses of manure&mdash;a patent had been taken
out for pressing it, to send by R.R. (stable manure). I&nbsp;never heard
anything more about it&mdash;and he was confident and enthusiastic
about&nbsp;it.</p>

<b>Feeding Farm Animals</b></p>

<p>By Professor <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Shaw</span>. This book
is intended alike for the student and the farmer. The author has
succeeded in giving in regular and orderly sequence, and in language so
simple that a child can understand it, the principles that govern the
science and practice of feeding farm animals. Professor Shaw is
certainly to be congratulated on the successful manner in which he has
accomplished a most difficult task. His book is unquestionably the most
practical work which has appeared on the subject of feeding farm
animals. Illustrated. 5½&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 inches. Upward of 500 pages.

<b>Profitable Dairying</b></p>

<p>By <span class = "smallcaps">C. L. Peck</span>. A&nbsp;practical
guide to successful dairy management. The treatment of the entire
subject is thoroughly practical, being principally a description of the
methods practiced by the author. A&nbsp;specially valuable part of this
book consists of a minute description of the far-famed model dairy farm
of Rev. J.D. Detrich, near Philadelphia, Pa. On the farm of fifteen
acres, which twenty years ago could not maintain one horse and two cows,
there are now kept twenty-seven dairy cattle, in addition to two horses.
All the roughage, litter, bedding, etc., necessary for these animals are
grown on these fifteen acres, more than most farmers could accomplish on
one hundred acres. Illustrated. 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;7 inches. 200 pages.

<b>Animal Breeding</b></p>

<p>By <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Shaw</span>. This book is the
most complete and comprehensive work ever published on the subject of
which it treats. It is the first book which has systematized the subject
of animal breeding. The leading laws which govern this most intricate
question the author has boldly defined and authoritatively arranged. The
chapters which he has written on the more involved features of the
subject, as sex and the relative influence of parents, should go far
toward setting at rest the wildly speculative views cherished with
reference to these questions. The striking originality in the treatment
of the subject is no less conspicuous than the superb order and regular
sequence of thought from the beginning to the end of the book. The book
is intended to meet the needs of all persons interested in the breeding
and rearing of live stock. Illustrated. 405 pages. 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;7

<b>Clovers and How to Grow Them</b></p>

<p>By <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Shaw</span>. This is the first
book published which treats on the growth, cultivation and treatment of
clovers as applicable to all parts of the United States and Canada, and
which takes up the entire subject in a systematic way and consecutive
