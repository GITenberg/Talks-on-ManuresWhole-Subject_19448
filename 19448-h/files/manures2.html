<h5>LAWES AND GILBERT’S EXPERIMENTS ON WHEAT.</h5>

<p>I hardly know how to commence an account of the wonderful experiments
made at Rothamsted, England, by John Bennett Lawes, Esq., and Dr. Joseph
H. Gilbert. Mr. Lawes’ first systematic experiment on wheat, commenced
in the autumn of 1843. A&nbsp;field of 14 acres of rather heavy clay
soil, resting on chalk, was selected for the purpose. Nineteen plots
were accurately measured and staked off. The plots ran the long way of
the field, and up a slight ascent. On each side of the field, alongside
the plots, there was some land not included, the first year, in the
experiment proper. This land was either left without manure, or a
mixture of the manures used in the experiments was sown on it.</p>

<p>I have heard it said that Mr. Lawes, at this time, was a believer in
what was called “Liebig’s Mineral Manure Theory.” Liebig had said that
“The crops on a field, diminish or increase in exact proportion to the
diminution or increase of the mineral substances conveyed to it in
manure.” And enthusiastic gentlemen have been known to tell farmers who
were engaged in drawing out farm-yard manure to their land, that they
were wasting their strength; all they needed was the mineral elements of
the manure. “And you might,” they said, “burn your manure, and sow the
ashes, and thus save much time and labor. The ashes will do just as much
good as the manure itself.”</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Lawes did, or did not entertain such an opinion,
I&nbsp;do not know. It looks as though the experiments the first year or
two, were made with the expectation that mineral manures, or the ashes
of plants, were what the wheat needed.</p>

<p>The following table gives the kind and quantities of manures used per
acre, and the yield of wheat per acre, as carefully cleaned for market.
Also the total weight of grain per acre, and the weight of straw and
chaff per acre.</p>

thus obtained by means of cheap preparations of the respective bases.
For the superphosphate of lime, the proportions were 5 parts bone-ash, 3
parts water, and 3 parts sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1.84; and for the
phosphates of potass, soda, and magnesia, they were 4 parts bone-ash,
water as needed, 3 parts sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1.84, and equivalent
amounts, respectively, of pearl-ash, soda-ash, or a mixture of 1 part
medicinal carbonate of magnesia, and 4 parts magnesian limestone. The

In this first season, neither the weight nor the measure of the offal
corn was recorded separately; and in former papers, the bushels and
pecks of total corn (including offal) have erroneously been given as
dressed corn. To bring the records more in conformity with those
relating to the other years, 5 per cent, by weight, has been deducted
from the total corn previously stated as dressed corn, and is recorded
as offal corn; this being about the probable proportion, judging from
the character of the season, the bulk of the crop, and the weight per
bushel of the dressed corn. Although not strictly correct, the
statements of dressed corn, as amended in this somewhat arbitrary way,
will approximate more nearly to the truth, and be more comparable with
those relating to other seasons, than those hitherto recorded.</p>

These were the results of the harvest of 1844. The first year of these
since celebrated experiments.</p>

<p>If Mr. Lawes expected that the crops would be in proportion to the
minerals supplied in the manure, he must have been greatly disappointed.
The plot without manure of any kind, gave 15 bushels of wheat per acre;
700 lbs. of superphosphate of lime, made from burnt bones, produced only
38 lbs. or about half a bushel more grain per acre, and 4 lbs.
<i>less</i> straw than was obtained without manure. 640 lbs. of
superphosphate, and 65 lbs. of commercial sulphate of ammonia (equal to
about 14 lbs. of ammonia), gave a little over 19½ bushels of dressed
wheat per acre. As compared with the plot having 700 lbs. of
superphosphate per acre, this 14 lbs. of available ammonia per acre, or,
say 11½ lbs. nitrogen, gave an increase of 324 lbs. of grain, and 252
lbs. of straw, or a total increase of 576 lbs. of grain and straw.</p>

<p>On plot No. 19, 81 lbs. of sulphate ammonia, with minerals, produces
24¼ bushels per acre. This yield is clearly due to the ammonia.</p>

<p>The rape-cake contains about 5 per cent of nitrogen, and is also rich
in minerals and <i>carbonaceous matter</i>. It gives an increase, but
not as large in proportion to the nitrogen furnished, as the sulphate of
ammonia. And the same remarks apply to the 14 tons of farm-yard
manure.</p>

<p>We should have expected a greater increase from such a liberal
dressing of barn-yard manure. I&nbsp;think the explanation is this:
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
The manure had not been piled. It was probably taken out fresh from the
yard (this, at any rate, was the case when I was at Rothamsted), and
plowed under late in the season. And on this heavy land, manure will lie
buried in the soil for months, or, if undisturbed, for years, without
decomposition. In other words, while this 14 tons of barn-yard manure,
contained at least 150 lbs. of nitrogen, and a large quantity of
minerals and carbonaceous matter, it did not produce a bushel per acre
more than a manure containing less than 12 lbs. of nitrogen. And on plot
19, a&nbsp;manure containing less than 15 lbs. of available nitrogen,
produced nearly 4 bushels per acre more wheat than the barn-yard manure
containing at least <i>ten times</i> as much nitrogen.</p>

<p>There can be but one explanation of this fact. The nitrogen in the
manure lay dormant in this heavy soil. Had it been a light sandy soil,
it would have decomposed more rapidly and produced a better effect.</p>

<p>As we have before stated, John Johnston finds, on his clay-land,
a&nbsp;far greater effect from manure spread on the surface, where it
decomposes rapidly, than when the manure is plowed under.</p>

<p>The Deacon was looking at the figures in the table, and not paying
much attention to our talk. “What could a man be thinking about,” he
said, “to burn 14 tons of good manure! It was a great waste, and I am
glad the ashes did no sort of good.”</p>

<p>After the wheat was harvested in 1844, the land was immediately
plowed, harrowed, etc.; and in a few weeks was plowed again and sown to
wheat, the different plots being kept separate, as before.</p>

<p>The following table shows the manures used this second year, and the
yield per acre:</p>

The season of 1845 was more favorable for wheat, than that of 1844, and
the crops on all the plots were better. On plot No. 3, which had no
manure last year, or this, the yield is 23 bushels per acre, against 15
bushels last year.</p>

<p>Last year, the 14 tons of barn-yard manure gave an <i>increase</i> of
only 5¼ bushels per acre. This year it gives an increase of nearly 9
bushels per acre.</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” said the Deacon, “that this plot, No. 2, had 14 tons
of manure in 1844, and 14 tons of manure again in 1845?”</p>

<p>“Precisely that, Deacon,” said I, “and this same plot has received
this amount of manure every year since, up to the present time&mdash;for
these same experiments are still continued from year to year at
Rothamsted.”</p>

<p>“It is poor farming,” said the Deacon, “and I should think the land
would get too rich to grow wheat.”</p>

<p>“It is not so,” said I, “and the fact is an interesting one, and
teaches a most important lesson, of which, more hereafter.”</p>

<p>Plot 5, last year, received 700 lbs. of superphosphate per acre. This
year, this plot was divided; one half was left without manure, and the
other dressed with 252 lbs. of pure carbonate of ammonia per acre. The
half without manure, (5a), did not produce quite as much grain and straw
as the plot which had received no manure for two years in succession.
But the wheat was of better quality, weighing 1 lb. more per bushel than
the other. Still it is sufficiently evident that superphosphate of lime
did no good so far as increasing the growth was concerned, either the
first year it was applied, or the year following.</p>

<p>The carbonate of ammonia was dissolved in water and sprinkled over
the growing wheat at three different times during the spring. You see
this manure, which contains no <i>mineral</i> matter at all, gives an
increase of nearly 4 bushels of grain per acre, and an increase of 887
lbs. of straw.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” said the Deacon, “is not 887 lbs. of straw to
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>
4 bushels of grain an unusually large proportion of straw to grain? I
have heard you say that 100 lbs. of straw to each bushel of wheat is
about the average. And according to this experiment, the carbonate of
ammonia produced over 200 lbs. of straw to a bushel of grain. How do you
account for this.”</p>

<p>“It is a general rule,” said I, “that the heavier the crop, the
greater is the proportion of straw to grain. On the no-manure plot, we
have, this year, 118 lbs. of straw to a bushel of dressed grain. Taking
this as the standard, you will find that the <i>increase</i> from
manures is proportionally greater in straw than in grain. Thus in the
increase of barn-yard manure, this year, we have about 133 lbs. of straw
to a bushel of grain. I&nbsp;do not believe there is any manure that
will give us a large crop of grain without a still larger crop of straw.
There is considerable difference, in this respect, between different
varieties of wheat. Still, I&nbsp;like to see a good growth of
straw.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“It is curious,” said the Doctor, “that 3 cwt. of ammonia-salts alone
on plots 9 and 10 should produce as much wheat as was obtained from plot
2, where 14 tons of barn-yard manure had been applied two years in
succession. I&nbsp;notice that on one plot, the ammonia-salts were
applied at once, in the spring, while on the other plot they were sown
at four different times&mdash;and that the former gave the best
results.”</p>

<p>The only conclusion to be drawn from this, is, that it is desirable
to apply the manure <i>early</i> in the spring&mdash;or better still, in
the autumn.</p>

<p>“You are a great advocate of Peruvian guano,” said the Deacon, “and
yet 3 cwt. of Peruvian guano on Plot 13, only produced an increase of
two bushels and 643 lbs. of straw per acre. The guano at $60 per ton,
would cost $9.00 per acre. This will not pay.”</p>

<p>This is an unusually small increase. The reason, probably, is to be
found in the fact that the manure and seed were not sown until March,
instead of in the autumn. The salts of ammonia are quite soluble and act
quickly; while the Peruvian guano has to decompose in the soil, and
consequently needs to be applied earlier, especially on clay land.</p>

<p>“I do not want you,” said the Deacon, “to dodge the question why an
application of 14 tons of farmyard-manure per acre, every year for over
thirty years, does not make the land too rich for wheat.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said I, “on light, sandy soil, such an annual dressing of
manure <i>would</i> in the course of a few years make the land too
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<a name = "page177" id = "page177"> </a>
rich for wheat. But on a clayey soil, such is evidently not the case.
And the fact is a very important one. When we apply manure, our object
should be to make it as available as possible. Nature preserves or

<p>“Please be a little more definite,” said the Deacon, “for I must
confess I do not quite see the significance of your remarks.”</p>

<p>“What he means,” said the Doctor, “is this: If you put a quantity of
soluble and available manure on land, and do not sow any crop, the
manure will not be wasted. The soil will retain it. It will change it
from a soluble into a comparatively insoluble form. Had a crop been sown
the first year, the manure would do far more good than it will the next
year, and yet it may be that none of the manure is lost. It is merely
locked up in the soil in such a form as will prevent it from running to
waste. If it was not for this principle, our lands would have been long
ago exhausted of all their available plant-food.”</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” said the Deacon; “but if what you say is
true, it upsets many of our old notions. We have thought it desirable to
plow under manure, in order to prevent the ammonia from escaping. You
claim, I&nbsp;believe, that there is little danger of any loss from
spreading manure on the surface, and I suppose you would have us
conclude that we make a mistake in plowing it under, as the soil renders
it insoluble.”</p>

<p>“It depends a good deal,” said I, “on the character of the soil.
A&nbsp;light, sandy soil will not preserve manure like a clay soil. But
it is undoubtedly true that our aim in all cases should be to apply
manure in such a form and to such a crop as will give us the greatest
<i>immediate</i> benefit. Plowing under fresh manure every year for
wheat is evidently not the best way to get the greatest benefit from it.
But this is not the place to discuss this matter. Let us look at the
result of Mr. Lawes’ experiments on wheat the third year:”</p>

Top-dressed in the Spring.</p>

<a name = "page180" id = "page180"> </a>
This year, the seed and manures were sown in the autumn. And I want the
Deacon to look at plot 0. 3 cwt. of Peruvian guano here gives an
increase of 10½ bushels of wheat, and 1,948 lbs. of straw per acre. This
will pay <i>well</i>, even on the wheat alone. But in addition to this,
we may expect, in our ordinary rotation of crops, a&nbsp;far better crop
of clover where the guano was used.</p>

<p>In regard to some of the results this year, Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert
have the following concise and interesting remarks:</p>

<p>“At this third experimental harvest, we have on the continuously
unmanured plot, namely, No. 3, not quite 18 bushels of dressed corn, as
the normal produce of the season; and by its side we have on plot
10<i>b</i>&mdash;comprising one-half of the plot 10 of the previous
years, and so highly manured by ammoniacal salts in 1845, but now
unmanured&mdash;rather more than 17½ bushels. The near approach, again,
to identity of result from the two unmanured plots, at once gives
confidence in the accuracy of the experiments, and shows us how
effectually the preceding crop had, in a practical point of view,
reduced the plots, previously so differently circumstanced both as to
manure and produce, to something like an uniform standard as regards
their grain-producing qualities.</p>

<p>“Plot 2 has, as before, 14 tons of farm-yard manure, and the produce
is 27¼ bushels, or between 9 and 10 bushels more than without manure of
any kind.</p>

<p>“On plot 10<i>a</i>, which in the previous year gave by ammoniacal
salts alone, a&nbsp;produce equal to that of the farm-yard manure, we
have again a similar result: for two cwts. of sulphate of ammonia has
now given 1,850 lbs. of total corn, instead of 1,826 lbs., which is the
produce on plot 2. The straw of the latter, is, however, slightly
heavier than that by the ammoniacal salt.</p>

<p>“Again, plot 5<i>a</i>, which was in the previous season
<i>unmanured</i>, was now subdivided: on one-half of it (namely,
5<i>a</i><sup>1</sup>) we have the ashes of wheat-straw alone, by which
there is an increase of rather more than one bushel per acre of dressed
corn; on the other half (or 5<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>) we have, besides the
straw-ashes, two cwts. of sulphate of ammonia put on as a top-dressing:
two cwts. of sulphate of ammonia have, in this case, only increased the
produce beyond that of 5<i>a</i><sup>1</sup> by 7⅞ bushels of corn and
768 lbs. of straw, instead of by 9¾ bushels of corn and 789 lbs. of
straw, which was the increase obtained by the same amount of ammoniacal
salt on 10<i>a</i>, as compared with 10<i>b</i>.</p>

<p>“It will be observed, however, that in the former case the ammoniacal
salts were top-dressed, but in the latter they were drilled at the time
of sowing the seed; and it will be remembered that in
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
<a name = "page181" id = "page181"> </a>
1845 the result was better <i>as to corn</i> on plot 9, where the salts
were sown earlier, than on plot 10, where the top-dressing extended far
into the spring. We have had several direct instances of this kind in
our experience, and we would give it as a suggestion, in most cases
applicable, that manures for wheat, and especially ammoniacal ones,
should be applied before or at the time the seed is sown; for, although
the apparent luxuriance of the crop is greater, and the produce of straw
really heavier, by spring rather than autumn sowings of Peruvian guano
and other ammoniacal manures, yet we believe that that of the
<i>corn</i> will not be increased in an equivalent degree. Indeed, the
success of the crop undoubtedly depends very materially on the progress
of the underground growth during the winter months; and this again,
other things being equal, upon the quantity of available nitrogenous
constituents within the soil, without a liberal provision of which, the
range of the fibrous feeders of the plant will not be such, as to take
up the minerals which the soil is competent to supply, and in such
quantity as will be required during the after progress of the plant for
its healthy and favorable growth.”</p>

<p>These remarks are very suggestive and deserve special attention.</p>

<p>“The next result to be noticed,” continue Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert,
“is that obtained on plot 6, now also divided into two equal portions
designated respectively 6<i>a</i> and 6<i>b</i>. Plot No. 6 had for the
crop of 1844, superphosphate of lime and the phosphate of magnesia
manure, and for that of 1845, superphosphate of lime, rape-cake, and
ammoniacal salts. For this, the third season, it was devoted to the
trial of the wheat-manure manufactured under the sanction of Professor
Liebig, and patented in this country.</p>

<p>“Upon plots 6<i>a</i>, four cwts. per acre of the patent wheat-manure
were used, which gave 20¼ bushels, or rather more than two bushels
beyond the produce of the unmanured plot; but as the manure contained,
besides the minerals peculiar to it, some nitrogenous compounds, giving
off a very perceptible odor of ammonia, some, at least, of the increase
would be due to that substance. On plot 6<i>b</i>, however, the further
addition of one cwt. each of sulphate and muriate of ammonia to this
so-called ‘Mineral Manure,’ gives a produce of 29¼ bushels. In other
words, the addition of ammoniacal salt, to Liebig’s mineral manure has
increased the produce by very nearly 9 bushels per acre beyond that of
the mineral manure alone, whilst the increase obtained over the
unmanured plot, by 14 tons of farm-yard manure, was only 9¼ bushels!</p>

Here again, I&nbsp;want the Deacon to look at plot 0, where 500 lbs.
Peruvian guano, sown in October, gives an <i>increase</i> of nearly 14
bushels of dressed wheat and 1,375 lbs. of straw per acre. On plot 2,
where 14 tons of barn-yard manure have now been applied four years in
succession (56 tons in all), there is a little more straw, but not quite
so much grain, as from the 500 lbs. of guano.</p>

<p>“But will the guano,” said the Deacon, “be as lasting as the
manure?”</p>

<p>“Not for wheat,” said I. “But if you seed the wheat down with clover,
as would be the case in this section, we should get considerable
benefit, probably, from the guano. If wheat was sown after the wheat,
the guano applied the previous season would do little good on the second
crop of wheat. And yet it is a matter of fact that there would be a
considerable proportion of the guano left in the soil. The wheat cannot
take it up. But the clover can. And we all know that if we can grow good
crops of clover, plowing it under, or feeding it out on the land, or
making it into hay and saving the manure obtained from it, we shall thus
be enabled to raise good crops of wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and
corn, and in this sense guano is a ‘lasting’ manure.”</p>

<p>“Barnyard-manure,” said the Doctor, “is altogether too ‘lasting.’
Here we have had 56 tons of manure on an acre of land in four years, and
yet an acre dressed with 500 lbs. of guano produces just as good a crop.
The manure contains far more plant-food, of all kinds, than the guano,
but it is so ‘lasting’ that it does not do half as much good as its
composition would lead us to expect. Its ‘lasting’ properties are a
decided objection, rather than an advantage. If we could make it less
lasting&mdash;in other words, if we could make it act quicker, it would
produce a greater effect, and possess a greater value. In proportion to
its constituents, the barn-yard manure is far cheaper than the guano,
but it has a less beneficial effect, because these constituents are not
more completely decomposed and rendered available.”</p>

<p>“That,” said I, “opens up a very important question. We have more
real value in manure than most of us are as yet able to bring out and
turn to good account. The sandy-land farmer has an advantage over the
clay-land farmer in this respect. The latter has a naturally richer
soil, but it costs him more to work it, and manure does not act so
rapidly. The clay-land farmer should use his best endeavors to decompose
his manure.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Doctor, “and, like John Johnston, he will probably
find it to his advantage to use it largely as a top-dressing on the
surface. Exposing manure to the atmosphere, spread out on
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
<a name = "page185" id = "page185"> </a>
the land for several months, and harrowing it occasionally, will do much
to render its constituents available. But let us return to Mr. Lawes’
wonderful experiments.”</p>

<p>“On eight plots,” said I, “300 lbs. of ammonia-salts were used
without any other manures, and the <i>average</i> yield on these eight
plots was nearly 26 bushels per acre, or an average increase of 9
bushels per acre. The same amount of ammonia-salts, with the addition of
superphosphate of lime, gave an increase of 13 bushels per acre. 400
lbs. ammonia salts, with superphosphate of lime, gave an <i>increase</i>
of nearly 16 bushels per acre, or three bushels per acre more than where
14 tons of barn-yard manure had been used four years in succession.</p>

<p>“I hope, after this, the Deacon will forgive me for dwelling on the
value of available nitrogen or ammonia as a manure for wheat.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Deacon, “that ground <i>rice</i> was used this year
for manure; and in 1845, <i>tapioca</i> was also used as a manure. The
Connecticut Tobacco growers a few years since used <i>corn-meal</i> for
manure, and you thought it a great waste of good food.”</p>

<p>I think so still. But we will not discuss the matter now. Mr. Lawes
wanted to ascertain whether <i>carbonaceous</i> matter was needed by the
growing wheat-plants, or whether they could get all they needed from the
soil and the atmosphere. The enormous quantities of carbonaceous matter
supplied by the barn-yard manure, it is quite evident, are of little
value as a manure for wheat. And the rice seems to have done very little
more good than we should expect from the 22 lbs. of nitrogen which it
contained. The large quantity of carbonaceous matter evidently did
little good. Available carbonaceous matter, such as starch, sugar, and
oil, was intended as food for man and beast&mdash;not as food for wheat
or tobacco.</p>

This season was considered unfavorable for wheat. The continuously
unmanured plot produced 14¾ bushels, and the plot receiving 14 tons of
barn yard manure, 25¾ bushels per acre nearly.</p>

<p>300 lbs. of ammonia-salts alone on plot 10<i>a</i>, gave 19¼ bushels
per acre, while the same quantity of ammonia, with superphosphate in
addition, gave, on plot 9<i>b</i>, 25 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>The addition to the above manures of 300 lbs. of potash, 200 lbs.
soda, and 100 lbs. sulphate of magnesia, on plot 10<i>b</i>, gave
precisely the same yield per acre as the ammonia and the superphosphate
alone. <i>The potash, soda, and magnesia, therefore, did no
good.</i></p>

<p>400 lbs. of ammonia-salts, with superphosphate, potash, etc., gave,
on plot 17<i>b</i>, nearly 29 bushels per acre, or 3½ bushels more than
the plot which has now received 70 tons of barn-yard manure in five
successive years.</p>

<p>“I see that, on plot 0,” said the Deacon, “one ton of superphosphate
was used per acre, and it gave only half a bushel per acre more than 350
lbs. on 9<i>a</i>.”</p>

<p>“This proves,” said I, “that an excessive dose of superphosphate will
do no harm. I&nbsp;am not sure that 100 lbs. of a good superphosphate
<i>drilled in with the seed</i>, would not have done <i>as much good</i>
as a ton per acre.”</p>

<p>“You say,” remarked the Deacon, “that the season was unfavorable for
wheat. And yet the no-manure plot produced nearly 15 bushels of wheat
per acre.”</p>

<p>“That is all true,” said I, “and yet the season was undoubtedly an
unfavorable one. This is shown not only in the less yield, but in the
inferior quality of the grain. The ‘dressed corn’ on the no-manure plot
this year only weighed 57⅓ lbs. per bushel, while last year it weighed
61 lbs. per bushel.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the Doctor, “what do Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert
mean by ‘dressed corn’?”</p>

<p>“By ‘corn,’” said I, “they mean wheat; and by ‘dressed corn’ they
mean wheat that has been run through a fanning-mill until all the light
and shrunken grain is blown or sieved out. In other words, ‘dressed
corn’ is wheat carefully cleaned for market. The English farmers take
more pains in cleaning their grain than we do. And this ‘dressed corn’
was as clean as a good fanning-mill could make it. You will observe that
there was more ‘offal corn’ this year than last. This also indicates an
unfavorable season.”</p>

<p>“It would have been very interesting,” said the Doctor, “if Messrs.
Lawes and Gilbert had analyzed the wheat produced by the different
manures, so that we might have known something in regard
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<a name = "page189" id = "page189"> </a>
to the quality of the flour as influenced by the use of different
fertilizers.”</p>

<p>“They did that very thing,” said I, “and not only that, but they made
the wheat grown on different plots, into flour, and ascertained the
yield of flour from a given weight of wheat, and the amount of bran,
middlings, etc., etc. They obtained some very interesting and important
results. I&nbsp;was there at the time. But this is not the place to
discuss the question. I&nbsp;am often amused, however, at the remarks we
often hear in regard to the inferior quality of our wheat as compared to
what it was when the country was new. Many seem to think that ‘there is
something lacking in the soil’&mdash;some say potash, and some
phosphates, and some this, and some that. I&nbsp;believe nothing of the
kind. Depend upon it, the variety of the wheat and the soil and season
have much more to do with the quality or strength of the flour, than the
chemical composition of the manures applied to the land.”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” said the Doctor, “we may be satisfied that anything
that will produce a vigorous, healthy growth of wheat is favorable to
quality. We may use manures in excess, and thus produce over-luxuriance
and an unhealthy growth, and have poor, shrunken grain. In this case, it
is not the use, but the abuse of the manure that does the mischief. We
must not manure higher than the season will bear. As yet, this question
rarely troubles us. Hitherto, as a rule, our seasons are better than our
farming. It may not always be so. We may find the liberal use of manure
so profitable that we shall occasionally use it in excess. At present,
however, the tendency is all the other way. We have more grain of
inferior quality from lack of fertility than from an excess of
plant-food.”</p>

<p>“That may be true,” said I, “but we have more poor, inferior wheat
from lack of draining and good culture, than from lack of plant-food.
Red-root, thistles, cockle, and chess, have done more to injure the
reputation of ‘Genesee Flour,’ than any other one thing, and I should
like to hear more said about thorough cultivation, and the destruction
of weeds, and less about soil exhaustion.”</p>

<p>“This was my last year at Rothamsted,” said I, “and I feel a peculiar
interest in looking over the results after such a lapse of time. When
this crop was growing, my father, a&nbsp;good practical farmer, but with
little faith in chemical manures, paid me a visit. We went to the
experimental wheat-field. The first two plots, 0 and 1, had been
dressed, the one with superphosphate, the other with potash, soda, and
magnesia. My father did not seem much impressed with this kind of
chemical manuring. Stepping to the next plot, where 14 tons of barn-yard
manure had been used, he remarked, “this is good, what have you
here?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said I, “we have better crops farther on.”</p>

<p>The next plot, No. 3, was the one continuously unmanured. “I&nbsp;can
beat this myself,” said he, and passed on to the next. “This is better,”
said he, “what have you here?”</p>

<p>“Superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a good crop, and the straw is bright and
stiff.”&mdash;It turned out 30 bushels per acre, 63 lbs. to the
bushel.</p>

<p>The next six plots had received very heavy dressings of
ammonia-salts, with superphosphate, potash, soda, and magnesia. He
examined them with the greatest interest. “What have you here?” he
asked, while he was examining 5<i>a</i>, which afterwards turned out 37¼
bushels per acre. &mdash;“Potash, soda, epsom-salts, superphosphate, and
ammonia&mdash;but it is the ammonia that does the good.”</p>

<p>He passed to the next plot, and was very enthusiastic over it. “What
have you here?” &mdash;“Rape-cake and ammonia,” said I. &mdash;“It is a
grand crop,” said he, and after examining it with great interest, he
passed to the next, 6<i>a</i>. &mdash;“What have you here?”
&mdash;“Ammonia,” said I; and at 6<i>b</i> he asked the same question,
and I replied “ammonia.” At 7<i>a</i>, the same question and the same
answer. Standing between 7<i>b</i> and 8<i>a</i>, he was of course
struck with the difference in the crop; 8<i>a</i> was left this year
without any manure, and though it had received a liberal supply of
mineral manures the year before, and minerals and ammonia-salts, and
rape-cake, the year previous, it only produced this year, 3½ bushels
more than the plot continuously unmanured. The contrast between the
wheat on this plot and the next one might well interest a practical
farmer. There was over 15 bushels per acre more wheat on the one plot
than on the other, and 1,581 lbs. more straw.</p>

<p>Passing to the next plot, he exclaimed “this is better, but not so
good as some that we have passed.” &mdash;“It has had a heavy dressing
of rape-cake,” said I, “equal to about 100 lbs. of ammonia per acre, and
the next plot was manured this year in the same way. The only difference
being that one had superphosphate and potash,
<span class = "pagenum">193</span>
<a name = "page193" id = "page193"> </a>
soda, and magnesia, the year before, while the other had superphosphate
alone.” It turned out, as you see from the table, that the potash, etc.,
only gave half a bushel more wheat per acre the year it was used, and
this year, with 2,000 lbs. of rape-cake on each plot, there is only a
bushel per acre in favor of the potash, soda, and magnesia.</p>

<p>The next plot, 9<i>b</i>, was also unmanured and was passed by my
father without comment. “Ah,” said he, on coming to the two next plots,
10<i>a</i> and 10<i>b</i>, “this is better, what have you here?”
&mdash;“<i>Nothing but ammonia</i>,” said I, “and I wish you would tell
me which is the best of the two? Last year 10<i>b</i> had a heavy
dressing of minerals and superphosphate with ammonia, and 10<i>a</i> the
same quantity of ammonia alone, without superphosphate or other mineral
manures. And this year both plots have had a dressing of 400 lbs. each
of ammonia-salts. Now, which is the best&mdash;the plot that had
superphosphate and minerals last year, or the one without?”
&mdash;“Well,” said he, “I&nbsp;can’t see any difference. Both are good
crops.”</p>

<p>You will see from the table, that the plot which had the
superphosphate, potash, etc., the year before, gives a peck <i>less</i>
wheat this year than the other plot which had none. Practically, the
yield is the same. There is an increase of 13 bushels of wheat per
acre&mdash;and this increase <i>is clearly due to the ammonia-salts
alone</i>.</p>

<p>The next plot was also a splendid crop.</p>

<p>“What have you here?”</p>

<p>“Superphosphate and ammonia.”</p>

<p>This plot (11<i>a</i>), turned out 35 bushels per acre. The next
plot, with phosphates and ammonia, was nearly as good. The next plot,
with potash, phosphates, and ammonia, equally good, but no better than
11<i>a</i>. There was little or no benefit from the potash, except a
little more <i>straw</i>. The next plot was good and I did not wait for
the question, but simply said, “ammonia,” and the next “ammonia,” and
the next “ammonia.”&mdash;Standing still and looking at the wheat, my
father asked, “Joe, where can I get this ammonia?” He had previously
been a little skeptical as to the value of chemistry, and had not a high
opinion of “book farmers,” but that wheat-crop compelled him to admit
“that perhaps, after all, there might be some good in it.” At any rate,
he wanted to know where he could get ammonia. And, now, as then, every
good farmer asks the same question: “Where can I get ammonia?” Before we
attempt to answer the question, let us look at the next year’s
experiments.&mdash;The following is the results of the experiments the
<i>seventh</i> year, 1849-50.</p>

The summer of 1850 was unusually cool and unfavorable for wheat. It will
be seen that on all the plots the yield of grain is considerably lower
than last year, with a greater growth of straw.</p>

<p>You will notice that 10<i>b</i>, which last year gave, with
ammonia-salts alone, 32¼ bushels, this year, with superphosphate,
potash, soda, and sulphate of magnesia, gives less than 18 bushels,
while the adjoining plot, dressed with ammonia, gives nearly 27 bushels.
In other words, the ammonia alone gives 9 bushels per acre more than
this large dressing of superphosphate, potash, etc.</p>

<p>On the three plots, 8<i>a</i>, 8<i>b</i> and 9<i>a</i>,
a&nbsp;dressing of ammonia-salts alone gives in <i>each case</i>,
a&nbsp;larger yield, both of grain and straw, than the 14 tons of
barn-yard manure on plot 2. And recollect that this plot has now
received 98 tons of manure in seven years.</p>

<p>“That,” said the Doctor, “is certainly a very remarkable fact.”</p>

<p>“It is so,” said the Deacon.</p>

<p>“But what of it?” asked the Squire, “even the Professor, here, does
not advise the use of ammonia-salts for wheat.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said I, “but perhaps I am mistaken. Such facts as those
just given, though I have been acquainted with them for many years,
sometimes incline me to doubt the soundness of my conclusions. Still, on
the whole, I&nbsp;think I am right.”</p>

<p>“We all know,” said the Deacon, “that you have great respect for your
own opinions.”</p>

<p>“Never mind all that,” said the Doctor, “but tell us just what you
think on this subject.”</p>

<p>“In brief,” said I, “my opinion is this. We need ammonia for wheat.
But though ammonia-salts and nitrate of soda can often be used with
decided profit, yet I feel sure that we can get ammonia or nitrogen at a
less cost per lb. by buying bran, malt-roots, cotton-seed cake, and
other foods, and using them for the double purpose of feeding stock and
making manure.”</p>

<p>“I admit that such is the case,” said the Doctor, “but here is a plot
of land that has now had 14 tons of manure every year for seven years,
and yet there is a plot along side, dressed with ammonia-salts
furnishing less than half the ammonia contained in the 14 tons of
manure, that produces a better yield of wheat.”</p>

<p>“That,” said I, “is simply because the nitrogen in the manure is not
in an available condition. And the practical question is, how to make
the nitrogen in our manure more immediately available. It is one of the
most important questions which agricultural science is called upon to
answer. Until we get more light, I&nbsp;feel
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<a name = "page197" id = "page197"> </a>
sure in saying that one of the best methods is, to feed our animals on
richer and more easily digested food.”</p>

Top-dressed in March, 1851.</p>

<a name = "page200" id = "page200"> </a>
The plot continuously unmanured, gives about 16 bushels of wheat per
acre.</p>

<p>The plot with barn-yard manure, nearly 30 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>400 lbs. of ammonia-salts <i>alone</i>, on plot 9<i>a</i>, 31¼
bushels; on 9<i>b</i>, 29 bushels; on 10<i>a</i> and 10<i>b</i>, nearly
29 bushels each. This is remarkable uniformity.</p>

<p>400 lbs. ammonia-salts and a large quantity of mineral manures in
addition, on <i>twelve</i> different plots, average not quite 32 bushels
per acre.</p>

<p>“The superphosphate and minerals,” said the Deacon, “do not seem to
do much good, that is a fact.”</p>

<p>You will notice that 336 lbs. of common salt was sown on plot
16<i>a</i>. It does not seem to have done the slightest good. Where the
salt was used, there is 2 lbs. less grain and 98 lbs. less straw than on
the adjoining plot 16<i>b</i>, where no salt was used, but otherwise
manured alike. It would seem, however, that the quality of the grain was
slightly improved by the salt. The salt was sown in March as a
top-dressing.</p>

<p>“It would have been better,” said the Deacon. “to have sown it in
autumn with the other manures.”</p>

<p>“The Deacon is right,” said I, “but it so happens that the next year
and the year after, the salt <i>was</i> applied at the same time as the
other manures. It gave an increase of 94 lbs. of grain and 61 lbs. of
straw in 1851, but the following year the same quantity of salt used on
the same plot did more harm than good.”</p>

<p>Before we leave the results of this year, it should be observed that
on 8<i>a</i>, 5,000 lbs. of cut straw and chaff were used per acre.
I&nbsp;do not recollect seeing anything in regard to it. And yet the
result was very remarkable&mdash;so much so indeed, that it is a matter
of regret that the experiment was not repeated.</p>

<p>This 5,000 lbs. of straw and chaff gave an increase of more than 10
bushels per acre over the continuously unmanured plot.</p>

<p>“Good,” said the Deacon, “I have always told you that you
under-estimated the value of straw, especially in regard to its
<i>mechanical</i> action.”</p>

<p>I did not reply to this remark of the good Deacon. I&nbsp;have never
doubted the good effects of anything that lightens up a clay soil and
renders it warmer and more porous. I&nbsp;suppose the great benefit
derived from this application of straw must be attributed to its
ameliorating action on the soil. The 5,000 lbs. of straw and chaff
produced a crop within nearly 3 bushels per acre of the plot manured
every year with 14 tons of barn-yard manure.</p>

<p>“I am surprised,” said the Doctor, “that salt did no good. I
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<a name = "page201" id = "page201"> </a>
have seen many instances in which it has had a wonderful effect on
wheat.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “and our experienced friend, John Johnston, is very
decidedly of the opinion that its use is highly profitable. He sows a
barrel of salt per acre broadcast on the land at the time he sows his
wheat, and I have myself seen it produce a decided improvement in the
crop.”</p>

<p>We have now given the results of the first <i>eight</i> years of the
experiments. From this time forward, the <i>same manures</i> were used
year after year on the same plot.</p>

<p>The results are given in the accompanying tables for the following
twelve years&mdash;harvests for 1852-53-54-55-56-57-58-59-60-61-62 and
1863. Such another set of experiments are not to be found in the world,
and they deserve and will receive the careful study of every intelligent
American farmer.</p>

<p>“I am with you there,” said the Deacon. “You seem to think that I do
not appreciate the labors of scientific men. I&nbsp;do. Such experiments
as these we are examining command the respect of every intelligent
farmer. I&nbsp;may not fully understand them, but I can see clearly
enough that they are of great value.”</p>

<p>The <i>ninth</i> season (1851-2), was unusually cold in June and wet
in August. It will be seen that the wheat, both in quantity and quality,
is the poorest since the commencement of the experiments. The unmanured
plot gave less than 14 bushels of dressed grain per acre; the plot with
barn-yard manure, less than 28 bushels, and the best yield in the whole
series was not quite 29 bushels per acre, and only weighed 55 lbs. per
bushel. On the same plot, the year before, with precisely the same
manure, the yield was nearly 37 bushels per acre, and the weight per
bushel, 63½ lbs. So much for a favorable and an unfavorable season.</p>

<p>The <i>tenth</i> season (1852-3), was still more unfavorable. The
autumn of 1852 was so wet that it was impossible to work the land and
sow the wheat until the 16th of March 1853.</p>

<p>You will see that the produce on the unmanured plot was less than 6
bushels per acre. With barn-yard manure, 19 bushels, and with a heavy
dressing of ammonia-salts and minerals, not quite 26 bushels per acre.
With a heavy dressing of superphosphate, not quite 9¼ bushels per acre,
and with a full dressing of mixed mineral manures and superphosphate, 10
bushels per acre.</p>

<p>The weight per bushel on the unmanured plot was 45 lbs.; with mixed
mineral manures, 48½ lbs.; with ammonia-salts alone, 48½ lbs.; with
barn-yard manure, 51 lbs.; and with ammonia-salts and mixed mineral
manures, 52¼ lbs.</p>

<p>Farmers are greatly dependent on the season, but the good farmer, who
keeps up the fertility of his land stands a better chance of making
money (or of losing less), than the farmer who depends on the unaided
products of the soil. The one gets 6 bushels per acre, and 1,413 lbs. of
straw of very inferior quality; the other gets 20 to 26 bushels per
acre, and 5,000 lbs. of straw. And you must recollect that in an
unfavorable season we are pretty certain to get high prices.</p>

<p>The <i>eleventh</i> season (1853-4,) gives us much more
attractive-looking figures! We have over 21 bushels per acre on the plot
which has grown eleven crops of wheat in eleven years without any
manure.</p>

<p>With barn-yard manure, over 41 bushels per acre. With ammonia-salts
alone (17<i>a</i>), 45¾ bushels. With ammonia-salts and mixed minerals,
(16<i>b</i>), over 50 bushels per acre, and 6,635 lbs. of straw.
A&nbsp;total produce of nearly 5½ tons per acre.</p>

<p>The <i>twelfth</i> season (1854-5), gives us 17 bushels of wheat per
acre on the continuously unmanured plot. Over 34½ bushels on the plot
manured with barn-yard manure. And I think, for the first time since the
commencement of the experiments, this plot produces
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
<a name = "page211" id = "page211"> </a>
the largest yield of any plot in the field. And well it may, for it has
now had, in twelve years, 168 tons of barn-yard manure per acre!</p>

<p>Several of the plots with ammonia-salts and mixed minerals, are
nearly up to it in grain, and ahead of it in straw.</p>

<p>The <i>thirteenth</i> season (1855-6), gives 14½ bushels on the
unmanured plot; over 36¼ bushels on the plot manured with barn-yard
manure; and over 40 bushels on 8<i>a</i>, dressed with 600 lbs.
ammonia-salts and mixed mineral manures. It will be noticed that 800
lbs. ammonia-salts does not give quite as large a yield this year as 600
lbs. I&nbsp;suppose 40 bushels per acre was all that the <i>season</i>
was capable of producing, and an extra quantity of ammonia did no good.
400 lbs. of ammonia-salts, on 7<i>a</i>, produced 37¼ bushels per acre,
and 800 lbs. on 16<i>b</i>, only 37¾ bushels. That extra half bushel of
wheat was produced at considerable cost.</p>

<p>The <i>fourteenth</i> season (1856-7), gives 20 bushels per acre on
the unmanured plot, and 41 bushels on the plot with barn-yard manure.
Mixed mineral manures alone on 5<i>a</i> gives nearly 23 bushels per
acre. Mixed mineral manures and 200 lbs. ammonia-salts, on 6<i>a</i>,
give 35¼ bushels. In other words the ammonia gives us over 12 extra
bushels of wheat, and 1,140 lbs. of straw. Mineral manures and 400 lbs.
ammonia-salts, on 7<i>b</i>, give 46¼ bushels per acre. Mineral manures
and 600 lbs. ammonia-salts, on 8<i>b</i>, give nearly 49 bushels per
acre. Mineral manures and 800 lbs. of ammonia-salts, on 16<i>b</i>, give
50 bushels per acre, and 4,703 lbs. of straw.</p>

<p>“This exceedingly heavy manuring,” said the Deacon, “does not pay.
For instance,</p>

<p>The Deacon is right, and Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert call especial
attention to this point. The 200 lbs. of ammonia-salts contain about 50
lbs. of ammonia, and the 400 lbs., 100 lbs. of ammonia. And as I have
said, 100 lbs. of ammonia per acre is an unusually heavy dressing. It is
as much ammonia as is contained in 1,000 lbs. of average Peruvian guano.
We will recur to this subject.</p>

<p>The <i>fifteenth</i> season (1857-8,) gives a yield of 18 bushels of
wheat per acre on the continuously unmanured plot, and nearly 39 bushels
on the plot continuously manured with 14 tons of barnyard manure. Mixed
mineral manures on 5<i>a</i> and 5<i>b</i>, give a mean yield of less
than 19 bushels per acre.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
Mixed mineral manures and 100 lbs. ammonia-salts, on plots 21 and 22,
give 23¼ bushels per acre. In other words:</p>

<p>“It takes,” said the Deacon, “about 5 lbs. of ammonia to produce a
bushel of wheat. And according to this, 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano,
guaranteed to contain 10 per cent of ammonia, would give an increase of
10 bushels of wheat.”</p>

<p>“This is a very interesting matter,” said I, “but we will not discuss
it at present. Let us continue the examination of the subject. I&nbsp;do
not propose to make many remarks on the tables. You must study them for
yourself. I&nbsp;have spent hours and days and weeks making and
pondering over these tables. The more you study them the more
interesting and instructive they become.”</p>

<p>The <i>sixteenth</i> season (1858-9), gives us a little over 18¼
bushels on the unmanured plot. On the plot manured with 14 tons farmyard
manure, 36¼ bushels; and this is the highest yield this season in the
wheat-field. Mixed mineral manures alone, (mean of plot 5<i>a</i> and
5<i>b</i>), give 20½ bushels.</p>

<p>25 lbs. ammonia (100 lbs. ammonia-salts), and mixed minerals, give
25¼ bushels, or an <i>increase</i> over minerals alone of 4¾
bushels.</p>

<p>The season was an unfavorable one for excessive manuring. It was too
wet and the crops of wheat when highly manured were much laid. The
quality of the grain was inferior, as will be seen from the light weight
per bushel.</p>

<p>The <i>seventeenth</i> season (1859-60,) gives less than 13 bushels
per acre on the unmanured plot; and 32¼ bushels on the plot manured with
14 tons farm-yard manure. This season (1860), was a miserable year for
wheat in England. It was both cold and wet. Mixed mineral manures, on
plots 5<i>a</i> and 5<i>b</i>, gave nearly 16 bushels per acre. 25 lbs.
ammonia, in addition to the above, gave less than 15 bushels. In other
words it gave no <i>increase</i> at all.</p>

<p>When we consider that this is the twentieth wheat-crop in succession
on the same land, these figures are certainly remarkable.</p>

<p>“They are so,” said the Deacon, “and what to me is the most
surprising thing about the whole matter is, that the plot which has had
no manure of any kind for 25 years, and has grown 20 wheat-crops in 20
successive years, should still produce a crop of wheat of 17¼ bushels
per acre. Many of our farmers do not average 10 bushels per acre. Mr.
Lawes must either have very good land, or else the
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
<a name = "page214" id = "page214"> </a>
climate of England is better adapted for wheat-growing than Western New
York.”</p>

<p>“I do not think,” said I, “that Mr. Lawes’ land is any better than
yours or mine; and I do not think the climate of England is any more
favorable for growing wheat without manure than our climate. If there is
any difference it is in our favor.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” asked the Doctor, “do we not grow as much wheat per acre
as Mr. Lawes gets from his continuously unmanured plot?”</p>

<p>This is a question not difficult to answer.</p>

<p>1st. <i>We grow too many weeds.</i> Mr. Lawes plowed the land twice
every year; and the crop was hoed once or twice in the spring to kill
the weeds.</p>

<p>2d. We do not half work our heavy land. We do not plow it
enough&mdash;do not cultivate, harrow, and roll enough. I&nbsp;have put
wheat in on my own farm, and have seen others do the same thing, when
the drill on the clay-spots could not deposit the seed an inch deep.
There is “plant-food” enough in these “clay-spots” to give 17 bushels of
wheat per acre&mdash;or perhaps 40 bushels&mdash;but we shall not get
ten bushels. The wheat will not come up until late in the
autumn&mdash;the plants will be weak and thin on the ground; and if they
escape the winter they will not get a fair hold of the ground until
April or May. You know the result. The straw is full of sap, and is
almost sure to rust; the grain shrinks up, and we harvest the crop, not
because it is worth the labor, but because we cannot cut the wheat with
a machine on the better parts of the field without cutting these poor
spots also. An acre or two of poor spots pull down the average yield of
the field below the average of Mr. Lawes’ well-worked but unmanured
land.</p>

<p>3d. Much of our wheat is seriously injured by stagnant water <i>in
the soil</i>, and standing water on the surface. I&nbsp;think we may
safely say that one-third the wheat-crop of this county (Monroe Co.,
N.Y.), is lost for want of better tillage and better draining&mdash;and
yet we think we have as good wheat-land and are as good farmers as can
be found in this country or any other!</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Unless we drain land, where drainage is needed, and unless we work
land thoroughly that needs working, and unless we kill the weeds or
check their excessive growth, it is poor economy to sow expensive
manures on our wheat-crops.</p>

<p>But I do not think there is much danger of our falling into this
error. The farmers who try artificial manures are the men who usually
take the greatest pains to make the best and most manure
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
<a name = "page215" id = "page215"> </a>
from the animals kept on the farm. They know what manures cost and what
they are worth. As a rule, too, such men are good farmers, and endeavor
to work their land thoroughly and keep it clean. When this is the case,
there can be little doubt that we can often use artificial manures to
great advantage.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“You say,” said the Deacon, who had been looking over the tables
while I was talking, “that mixed mineral manures and 50 lbs. of ammonia
give 39¾ bushels per acre. Now these mixed mineral manures contain
potash, soda, magnesia, and superphosphate. And I see where
superphosphate was used without any potash, soda, and magnesia, but with
the same amount of ammonia, the yield is nearly 46 bushels per acre.
This does not say much in favor of potash, soda, and magnesia, as
manures, for wheat. Again, I&nbsp;see, on plot 10<i>b</i>, 50 lbs. of
ammonia, <i>alone</i>, gives over 43½ bushels per acre. On plot
11<i>b</i>, 50 lbs. ammonia <i>and</i> superphosphate, give 46½ bushels.
Like your father, I&nbsp;am inclined to ask, ‘<i>Where can I get this
ammonia?</i>’”</p>

<h5>LIME AS A MANURE.</h5>

<p>These careful, systematic, and long-continued experiments of Lawes
and Gilbert seem to prove that if you have a piece of land well prepared
for wheat, which will produce, without manure, say 15 bushels per acre,
there is no way of making that land produce 30 bushels of wheat per
acre, without directly or indirectly furnishing the soil with a liberal
supply of available nitrogen or ammonia.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by directly or indirectly?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>“What I had in my mind,” said I, “was the fact that I have seen a
good dressing of lime double the yield of wheat. In such a case I
suppose the lime decomposes the organic matter in the soil, or in some
other way sets free the nitrogen or ammonia already in the soil; or the
lime forms compounds in the soil which attract ammonia from the
atmosphere. Be this as it may, the facts brought out by Mr. Lawes’
experiments warrant us in concluding that the increased growth of wheat
was connected in some way with an increased supply of available nitrogen
or ammonia<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">216</span>
<a name = "page216" id = "page216"> </a>
My father used great quantities of lime as manure. He drew it a distance
of 13 miles, and usually applied it on land intended for wheat,
spreading it broad-cast, after the land had received its last plowing,
and harrowing it in, a&nbsp;few days or weeks before sowing the wheat.
He rarely applied less than 100 bushels of stone-lime to the
acre&mdash;generally 150 bushels. He used to say that a small dose of
lime did little or no good. He wanted to use enough to change the
general character of the land&mdash;to make the light land firmer and
the heavy land lighter.</p>

<p>While I was with Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert at Rothamsted, I&nbsp;went
home on a visit. My father had a four-horse team drawing lime every day,
and putting it in large heaps in the field to slake, before spreading it
on the land for wheat.</p>

<p>“I do not believe it pays you to draw so much lime,” said I, with the
confidence which a young man who has learned a little of agricultural
chemistry, is apt to feel in his newly acquired knowledge.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said my father, “but we have got to do something for
the land, or the crops will be poor, and poor crops do not pay these
times. What would you use instead of lime?” &mdash;“Lime is not a
manure, strictly speaking,” said I; “a bushel to the acre would furnish
all the lime the crops require, even if there was not an abundant supply
already in the soil. If you mix lime with guano, it sets free the
ammonia; and when you mix lime with the soil it probably decomposes some
compounds containing ammonia or the elements of ammonia, and thus
furnishes a supply of ammonia for the plants. I&nbsp;think it would be
cheaper to buy ammonia in the shape of Peruvian guano.”</p>

<p>After dinner, my father asked me to take a walk over the farm. We
came to a field of barley. Standing at one end of the field, about the
middle, he asked me if I could see any difference in the crop. “Oh,
yes,” I replied, “the barley on the right-hand is far better than on the
left hand. The straw is stiffer and brighter, and the heads larger and
heavier. I&nbsp;should think the right half of the field will be ten
bushels per acre better than the other.”</p>

<p>“So I think,” he said, “and now can you tell me why?”
&mdash;“Probably you manured one half the field for turnips, and not the
other half.” &mdash;“No.” &mdash;“You may have drawn off the turnips
from half the field, and fed them off by sheep on the other half.”
&mdash;“No, both sides were treated precisely alike.” &mdash;I gave it
up &mdash;“Well,” said he, “this half the field on the right-hand was
limed, thirty years ago, and that is the only reason I know for the
difference. And now you need not tell me that lime does not pay.”</p>

<p>I can well understand how this might happen. The system of
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<a name = "page217" id = "page217"> </a>
rotation adopted was, 1st clover, 2d wheat, 3d turnips, 4th barley,
seeded with clover.</p>

<p>Now, you put on, say 150 bushels of lime for wheat. After the wheat
the land is manured and sown with turnips. The turnips are eaten off on
the land by sheep; and it is reasonable to suppose that on the half of
the field dressed with lime there would be a much heavier crop of
turnips. These turnips being eaten off by the sheep would furnish more
manure for this half than the other half. Then again, when the land was
in grass or clover, the limed half would afford more and sweeter grass
and clover than the other half, and the sheep would remain on it longer.
They would eat it close into the ground, going only on to the other half
when they could not get enough to eat on the limed half. More of their
droppings would be left on the limed half of the field. The lime, too,
would continue to act for several years; but even after all direct
benefit from the lime had ceased, it is easy to understand why the crops
might be better for a long period of time.</p>

<p>“Do you think lime would do any good,” asked the Deacon, “on our
limestone land?”&mdash;I certainly do. So far as I have seen, it does
just as much good here in Western New York, as it did on my father’s
farm. I&nbsp;should use it very freely if we could get it cheap
enough&mdash;but we are charged from 25 to 30 cts. a&nbsp;bushel for it,
and I do not think at these rates it will pay to use it. Even gold may
be bought <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘to’">too</ins>
dear.</p>

<p>“You should burn your own lime,” said the Deacon, “you have plenty of
limestone on the farm, and could use up your down wood.”&mdash;I believe
it would pay me to do so, but one man cannot do everything. I&nbsp;think
if farmers would use more lime for manure we should get it cheaper. The
demand would increase with competition, and we should soon get it at its
real value. At 10 to 15 cents a bushel, I&nbsp;feel sure that we could
use lime as a manure with very great benefit.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“I was much interested some years ago,” said the Doctor, “in the
results of Prof. Way’s investigations in regard to the absorptive powers
of soils.”</p>

<p>His experiments, since repeated and confirmed by other chemists,
formed a new epoch in agricultural chemistry. They afforded some new
suggestions in regard to how lime may benefit land.</p>

<p>Prof. Way found that ordinary soils possessed the power of
separating, from solution in water, the different earthy and alkaline
substances presented to them in manure; thus, when solutions of salts of
ammonia, of potash, magnesia, etc., were made to filter
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>
<a name = "page218" id = "page218"> </a>
slowly through a bed of dry soil, five or six inches deep, arranged in a
flower-pot, or other suitable vessel, it was observed that the liquid
which ran through, no longer contained any of the ammonia or other salt
employed. The soil had, in some form or other, retained the alkaline
substance, while the water in which it was previously dissolved passed
through.</p>

<p>Further, this power of the soil was found not to extend to the whole
salt of ammonia or potash, but only to the alkali itself. If, for
instance, sulphate of ammonia were the compound used in the experiments,
the ammonia would be removed from solution, but the filtered liquid
would contain sulphuric acid in abundance&mdash;not in the free or
uncombined form, but united to lime; instead of sulphate of ammonia we
should find sulphate of lime in the solution; and this result was
obtained, whatever the acid of the salt experimented upon might be.</p>

<p>It was found, moreover, that the process of filtration was by no
means necessary; by the mere mixing of an alkaline solution with a
proper quantity of soil, as by shaking them together in a bottle, and
allowing the soil to subside, the same result was obtained. The action,
therefore, was in no way referable to any physical law brought into
operation by the process of filtration.</p>

<p>It was also found that the combination between the soil and the
alkaline substance was rapid, if not instantaneous, partaking of the
nature of the ordinary union between an acid and an alkali.</p>

<p>In the course of these experiments, several different soils were
operated upon, and it was found that all soils capable of profitable
cultivation possessed this property in a greater or less degree.</p>

<p>Pure sand, it was found, did not possess this property. The organic
matter of the soil, it was proved, had nothing to do with it. The
addition of carbonate of lime to a soil did not increase its absorptive
power, and indeed it was found that a soil in which carbonate of lime
did not exist, possessed in a high degree the power of removing ammonia
or potash from solution.</p>

<p>To what, then, is the power of soils to arrest ammonia, potash,
magnesia, phosphoric acid, etc., owing? The above experiments lead to
the conclusion that it is due to the <i>clay</i> which they contain. In
the language of Prof. Way, however,</p>

<p>“It still remained to be considered, whether the whole clay took any
active part in these changes, or whether there existed in clay some
chemical compound in small quantity to which the action was due. This
question was to be decided by the extent to which clay was able to unite
with ammonia, or other alkaline bases; and it soon became evident that
the idea of the clay as a
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
<a name = "page219" id = "page219"> </a>
whole, being the cause of the absorptive property, was inconsistent with
all the ascertained laws of chemical combination.”</p>

<p>After a series of experiments, Prof. Way came to the conclusion that
there is in clays a peculiar class of double silicates to which the
absorptive properties of soil are due. He found that the double silicate
of alumina and lime, or soda, whether found naturally in soils or
produced artificially, would be decomposed when a salt of ammonia, or
potash, etc., was mixed with it, the ammonia, or potash, taking the
place of the lime or soda.</p>

<p>Prof. Way’s discovery, then, is not that soils have “absorptive
properties”&mdash;that has been long known&mdash;but that they absorb
ammonia, potash, phosphoric acid, etc., by virtue of the double silicate
of alumina and soda, or lime, etc., which they contain.</p>

<p>Soils are also found to have the power of absorbing ammonia, or
rather <i>carbonate</i> of ammonia, from the air.</p>

<p>“It has long been known,” says Prof. Way, “that soils acquire
fertility by exposure to the influence of the atmosphere&mdash;hence one
of the uses of fallows.<span class = "pad1">&nbsp;**</span>I find that
clay is so greedy of ammonia, that if air, charged with carbonate of
ammonia, so as to be highly pungent, is passed through a tube filled
with small fragments of dry clay, <i>every particle of the gas is
arrested</i>.”</p>

<p>This power of the soil to absorb ammonia, is also due to the double
silicates. But there is this remarkable difference, that while either
the lime, soda, or potash silicate is capable of removing the ammonia
from <i>solution</i>, the <i>lime</i> silicate alone <i>has the power of
absorbing it from the air</i>.</p>

<p>This is an important fact. Lime may act beneficially on many or most
soils by converting the soda silicate into a lime silicate, or, in other
words, converting a salt that will not absorb carbonate of ammonia from
the air, into a salt that has this important property.</p>

<p>There is no manure that has been so extensively used, and with such
general success as lime, and yet, “who among us,” remarks Prof. Way,
“can say that he perfectly understands the mode in which lime acts?” We
are told that lime sweetens the soil, by neutralizing any acid character
that it may possess; that it assists the decomposition of inert organic
matters, and therefore increases the supply of vegetable food to plants:
that it decomposes the remains of ancient rocks containing potash, soda,
magnesia, etc., occurring in most soils, and that at the same time it
liberates silica from these rocks; and lastly, that lime is one of the
substances found uniformly and in considerable quantity in the ashes of
plants, that therefore its application may be beneficial simply as
furnishing a material indispensable to the substance of a plant.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">220</span>
<a name = "page220" id = "page220"> </a>
These explanations are no doubt good as far as they go, but experience
furnishes many facts which cannot be explained by any one, or all, of
these suppositions. Lime, we all know, does much good on soils abounding
in organic matter, and so it frequently does on soils almost destitute
of it. It may liberate potash, soda, silica, etc., from clay soils, but
the application of potash, soda, and silica has little beneficial effect
on the soil, and therefore we cannot account for the action of lime on
the supposition that it renders the potash, soda, etc., of the soil
available to plants. Furthermore, lime effects great good on soils
abounding in salts of lime, and therefore it cannot be that it operates
as a source of lime for the structure of the plant.</p>

<p>None of the existing theories, therefore, satisfactorily account for
the action of lime. Prof. Way’s views are most consistent with the facts
of practical experience; but they are confessedly hypothetical; and his
more recent investigations do not confirm the idea that lime acts
beneficially by converting the soda silicate into the lime silicate.</p>

<p>Thus, six soils were treated with lime water until they had absorbed
from one and a half to two per cent of their weight of lime. This,
supposing the soil to be six inches deep, would be at the rate of about
300 bushels of lime per acre. The amount of ammonia in the soil was
determined before liming, after liming, and then after being exposed to
the fumes of carbonate ammonia until it had absorbed as much as it
would. The following table exhibits the results:</p>

<p>It is evident that lime neither assisted nor interfered with the
absorption of ammonia, and hence the beneficial effect of liming on such
soils must be accounted for on some other supposition. This negative
result, however, does not disprove the truth of Prof. Way’s hypothesis,
for it may be that the silicate salt in the natural soils was that of
lime and not that of soda. Indeed, the extent to
<span class = "pagenum">221</span>
<a name = "page221" id = "page221"> </a>
which the natural soils absorbed ammonia&mdash;equal, in No. 3, to about
7,000 lbs. of ammonia per acre, equivalent to the quantity contained in
700 tons of barn-yard manure&mdash;shows this to have been the case.</p>

<p><i>The lime liberated one-half the ammonia contained in the
soil.</i></p>

<p>“This result,” says Prof. Way, “is so nearly the same in all cases,
that we are justified in believing it to be due to some special cause,
and probably it arises from the existence of some compound silicates
containing ammonia, of which lime under the circumstances can replace
one-half&mdash;forming, for instance, a&nbsp;double silicate of alumina,
with half lime and half ammonia&mdash;such compounds are not unusual or
new to the chemist.”</p>

<p>This loss of ammonia from a heavy dressing of lime is very great.
A&nbsp;soil five inches deep, weighs, in round numbers, 500 tons, or
1,000,000 lbs. The soil, No. 1, contained .0293 per cent of ammonia, or
in an acre, five inches deep, 293 lbs. After liming, it contained .0169
per cent, or in an acre, five inches deep, 169 lbs. The loss by liming
is 124 lbs. of ammonia per acre. This is equal to the quantity contained
in 1200 lbs. of good Peruvian guano, or 12½ tons of barn-yard
manure.</p>

<p>In commenting on this great loss of ammonia from liming, Prof. Way
observes:</p>

<p>“Is it not possible, that for the profitable agricultural use, the
ammonia of the soil is too tightly locked up in it? Can we suppose that
the very powers of the soil to unite with and preserve the elements of
manure are, however excellent a provision of nature, yet in some degree
opposed to the growth of the abnormal crops which it is the business of
the farmer to cultivate? There is no absolute reason why such should not
be the case. A&nbsp;provision of nature must relate to natural
circumstances; for instance, compounds of ammonia may be found in the
soil, capable of giving out to the agencies of water and air quite
enough of ammonia for the growth of ordinary plants and the preservation
of their species; but this supply may be totally inadequate to the
necessities of man.<span class = "pad1"> ***</span> Now it is not
impossible that the laws which preserve the supply of vegetable
nutrition in the soil, are too stringent for the requirements of an
unusual and excessive vegetation, such as the cultivator must
promote.</p>

<p>“In the case of ammonia locked up in the soil, lime may be the remedy
at the command of the farmer&mdash;his means of rendering immediately
available stores of wealth, which can otherwise only slowly be brought
into use.</p>

<p>“In this view, lime would well deserve the somewhat vague
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<a name = "page222" id = "page222"> </a>
name that has been given it, namely, that of a ‘stimulant’; for its
application would be in some sort an application of ammonia, while its
excessive application, by driving off ammonia, would lead to all the
disastrous effects which are so justly attributed to it.</p>

<p>“I do not wish to push this assumption too far,” says Prof. Way, in
conclusion, “but if there be any truth in it, it points out the
importance of employing lime in small quantities at short intervals,
rather than in large doses once in many years.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“The Squire, last year,” said the Deacon, “drew several hundred
bushels of refuse lime from the kiln, and mixed it with his manure. It
made a powerful smell, and not an agreeable one, to the passers by. He
put the mixture on a twenty-acre field of wheat, and he said he was
going to beat you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “so I understood&mdash;but he did not do it. If he had
applied the lime and the manure separately, he would have stood a better
chance; still, there are two sides to the question. I&nbsp;should not
think of mixing lime with good, rich farm-yard manure; but with long,
coarse, strawy manure, there would be less injury, and possibly some
advantage.”</p>

<p>“The Squire,” said the Deacon, “got one advantage. He had not much
trouble in drawing the manure about the land. There was not much of it
left.”</p>

<p>Lime does not always decompose organic matter. In certain conditions,
it will <i>preserve</i> vegetable substances. We do not want to mix lime
with manure in order to preserve it; and if our object is to increase
fermentation, we must be careful to mix sufficient soil with the manure
to keep it moist enough to retain the liberated ammonia.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Many farmers who use lime for the first time on wheat, are apt to
feel a little discouraged in the spring. I&nbsp;have frequently seen
limed wheat in the spring look worse than where no lime was used. But
wait a little, and you will see a change for the better, and at harvest,
the lime will generally give a good account of itself.</p>

<p>There is one thing about lime which, if generally true, is an
important matter to our wheat-growers. Lime is believed to hasten the
maturity of the crop. “It is true of nearly all our cultivated crops,”
says the late Professor Johnston, “but especially of those of wheat,
that their full growth is attained more speedily when the land is limed,
and that they are ready for the harvest from ten to fourteen days
earlier. This is the case even with buckwheat,
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223" id = "page223"> </a>
which becomes sooner ripe, though it yields no larger a return when lime
is applied to the land on which it is grown.”</p>

<p>In districts where the midge affects the wheat, it is exceedingly
important to get a variety of wheat that ripens early; and if lime will
favor early maturity, without checking the growth, it will be of great
value.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>A correspondent in Delaware writes: “I&nbsp;have used lime as a
manure in various ways. For low land, the best way is, to sow it
broadcast while the vegetation is in a green state, at the rate of 40 or
50 bushels to the acre; but if I can not use it before the frost kills
the vegetation, I&nbsp;wait until the land is plowed in the spring, when
I spread it on the plowed ground in about the same quantity as before.
Last year, I&nbsp;tried it both ways, and the result was, my crop was
increased at least fourfold in each instance, but that used on the
vegetation was best. The soil is a low, black sand.”</p>

<p>A farmer writes from New Jersey, that he has used over 6,000 bushels
of lime on his farm, and also considerable guano and phosphates, but
considers that the lime has paid the best. His farm has more than
doubled in real value, and he attributes this principally to the use of
lime.</p>

<p>“We lime,” he says, “whenever it is convenient, but prefer to put it
on at least one year before plowing the land. We spread from 25 to 40
bushels of lime on the sod in the fall; plant with corn the following
summer; next spring, sow with oats and clover; and the next summer, plow
under the clover, and sow with wheat and timothy. We have a variety of
soils, from a sandy loam to a stiff clay, and are certain that lime will
pay on all or any of them. Some of the best farmers in our County
commenced liming when the lime cost 25 cts. a&nbsp;bushel, and their
farms are ahead yet, more in value, I&nbsp;judge, than the lime cost.
The man who first commences using lime, will get so far ahead, while his
neighbors are looking on, that they will never catch up.”</p>

<p>Another correspondent in Hunterdon Co., N.J., writes: “Experience has
taught me that the best and most profitable mode of applying lime is on
grass land. If the grass seed is sown in the fall with the wheat or rye,
which is the common practice with us in New Jersey, as soon as the
harvest comes off the next year, we apply the lime with the least delay,
and while fresh slacked and in a dry and mealy state. It can be spread
more evenly on the ground, and is in a state to be more readily taken up
by the fine roots of the plants, than if allowed to get wet and clammy.
It is found most beneficial to keep it as near the surface of the ground
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224" id = "page224"> </a>
as practicable, as the specific gravity or weight of this mineral manure
is so great, that we soon find it too deep in the ground for the fibrous
roots of plants to derive the greatest possible benefit from its use.
With this method of application are connected several advantages. The
lime can be hauled in the fall, after the busy season is over, and when
spread on the sod in this way, comes in more immediate contact with the
grass and grass-roots than when the land is first plowed. In fields that
have been limed in part in this manner, and then plowed, and lime
applied to the remainder at the time of planting with corn,
I&nbsp;always observe a great difference in the corn-crop; and in
plowing up the stubble the next season, the part limed on the sod is
much mellower than that limed after the sod was broken, presenting a
rich vegetable mould not observed in the other part of the field.”</p>

<p>A farmer in Chester Co., Pa., also prefers to apply lime to
newly-seeded grass or clover. He puts on 100 bushels of slaked lime per
acre, either in the fall or in the spring, as most convenient. He limes
one field every year, and as the farm is laid off into eleven fields,
all the land receives a dressing of lime once in eleven years.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>In some sections of the country, where lime has been used for many
years, it is possible that part of the money might better be used in the
purchase of guano, phosphates, fish-manure, etc.; while in this section,
where we seldom use lime, we might find it greatly to our interest to
give our land an occasional dressing of lime.</p>

<p>The value of <ins class = "correction" title =
"hyphen in original">quick-lime</ins> as a manure is not merely in
supplying an actual constituent of the plant. If it was, a&nbsp;few
pounds per acre would be sufficient. Its value consists in changing the
chemical and physical character of the soil&mdash;in developing the
latent mineral plant-food, and in decomposing and rendering available
organic matter, and in forming compounds which attract ammonia from the
atmosphere. It may be that we can purchase this ammonia and other
plant-food cheaper than we can get it by using lime. It depends a good
deal on the nature and composition of the soil. At present, this
question can not be definitely settled, except by actual trial on the
farm. In England, where lime was formerly used in large quantities, the
tendency for some time has been towards a more liberal and direct use of
ammonia and phosphates in manures, rather than to develop them out of
the soil by the use of lime. A&nbsp;judicious combination of the two
systems will probably be found the most profitable.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Making composts with old sods, lime, and barn-yard manure, is
<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
<a name = "page225" id = "page225"> </a>
a time-honored practice in Europe. I&nbsp;have seen excellent results
from the application of such a compost on meadow-land. The usual plan
is, to select an old hedge-row or headland, which has lain waste for
many years. Plow it up, and cart the soil, sods, etc., into a long,
narrow heap. Mix lime with it, and let it lie six months or a year. Then
turn it, and as soon as it is fine and mellow, draw it on to the land.
I&nbsp;have assisted at making many a heap of this kind, but do not
recollect the proportion of lime used; in fact, I&nbsp;question if we
had any definite rule. If we wanted to use lime on the land, we put more
in the heap; if not, less. The manure was usually put in when the heap
was turned.</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker analyzed the dry earth used in the closets at the prison
in Wakefield, England. He found that:</p>

<table summary = "modest table">

<td>102 &nbsp; ”</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>After looking at the above figures, the Deacon remarked: “You say 10
tons of dry earth before being used in the closet contained 62 lbs. of
nitrogen. How much nitrogen does 10 tons of barn-yard manure
contain?”</p>

<p>“That depends a good deal on what food the animals eat. Ten tons of
average fresh manure would contain about 80 lbs. of nitrogen.”</p>

<p>“Great are the mysteries of chemistry!” exclaimed the Deacon. “Ten
tons of dry earth contain almost as much nitrogen as 10 tons of
barn-yard manure, and yet you think that nitrogen is the most valuable
thing in manure. What shall we be told next?”</p>

<p>“You will be told, Deacon, that the nitrogen in the soil is in such a
form that the plants can take up only a small portion of it. But if you
will plow such land in the fall, and expose it to the disintegrating
effects of the frost, and plow it again in the spring, and let the sun
and air act upon it, more or less of the organic matter in the soil will
be decomposed, and the nitrogen rendered soluble. And then if you sow
this land to wheat after a good summer-fallow, you will stand a chance
of having a great crop.”</p>

<p>This dry earth which Dr. Vœlcker analyzed appeared, he says, “to be
ordinary garden soil, containing a considerable portion of clay.” After
it had been passed once through the closet, one ton of it was spread on
an acre of grass-land, which produced 2 tons 8 cwt. of hay. In a second
experiment, one ton, once passed through the closet, produced 2 tons 7
cwt. of hay per acre. We are not told how much hay the land produced
without any dressing
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226" id = "page226"> </a>
at all. Still we may infer that this top-dressing did considerable good.
Of one thing, however, there can be no doubt. This one ton of earth
manure contained only 1¼ lb. more nitrogen and 1½ lb. more phosphoric
acid than a ton of the dry earth itself. Why then did it prove so
valuable as a top-dressing for grass? I will not say that it was due
solely to the decomposition of the nitrogenous matter and other
plant-food in the earth, caused by the working over and sifting and
exposure to the air, and to the action of the night-soil. Still it would
seem that, so far as the beneficial effect was due to the supply of
plant-food, we must attribute it to the earth itself rather than to the
small amount of night-soil which it contained.</p>

<p>It is a very common thing in England, as I have said before, for
farmers to make a compost of the sods and earth from an old hedge-row,
ditch, or fence, and mix with it some lime or barn-yard manure. Then,
after turning it once or twice, and allowing it to remain in the heap
for a few months, to spread it on meadow-land. I&nbsp;have seen great
benefit apparently derived from such a top-dressing. The young grass in
the spring assumed a rich, dark green color. I&nbsp;have observed the
same effect where coal-ashes were spread on grass-land; and I have
thought that the apparent benefit was due largely to the material acting
as a kind of mulch, rather than to its supplying plant-food to the
grass.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>I doubt very much whether we can afford to make such a compost of
earth with lime, ashes, or manure in this country. But I feel sure that
those of us having rich clay land containing, in an inert form, as much
nitrogen and phosphoric acid as Dr. Vœlcker found in the soil to be used
in the earth-closet at Wakefield, can well afford to stir it freely, and
expose it to the disintegrating and decomposing action of the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>An acre of dry soil six inches deep weighs about 1,000 tons; and
consequently an acre of such soil as we are talking about would contain
6,200 lbs. of nitrogen, and 3,600 lbs. of phosphoric acid. In other
words, it contains to the depth of only six inches as much nitrogen as
would be furnished by 775 tons of common barn-yard manure, and as much
phosphoric acid as 900 tons of manure. With such facts as these before
us, am I to blame for urging farmers to cultivate their land more
thoroughly? I do not know that my land or the Deacon’s is as rich as
this English soil; but, at any rate, I&nbsp;see no reason why such
should not be the case.</p>

CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h4>

<h5>MANURES FOR BARLEY.</h5>

<p>Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert have published the results of experiments
with different manures on barley grown annually on the same land for
twenty years in succession. The experiments commenced in 1852.</p>

<p>The soil is of the same general character as that in the field on the
same farm where wheat was grown annually for so many years, and of which
we have given such a full account. It is what we should call a
calcareous clay loam. On my farm, we have what the men used to call
“clay spots.” These spots vary in size from two acres down to the tenth
of an acre. They rarely produced even a fair crop of corn or potatoes,
and the barley was seldom worth harvesting. Since I have drained the
land and taken special pains to bestow extra care in plowing and working
these hard and intractable portions of the fields, the “clay spots” have
disappeared, and are now nothing more than good, rather stiff, clay
loam, admirably adapted for wheat, barley, and oats, and capable of
producing good crops of corn, potatoes, and mangel-wurzels.</p>

<p>The land on which Mr. Lawes’ wheat and barley experiments were made
is not dissimilar in general character from these “clay spots.” If the
land was only half-worked, we should call it clay; but being thoroughly
cultivated, it is a good clay loam. Mr. Lawes describes it as “a
somewhat heavy loam, with a subsoil of raw, yellowish red clay, but
resting in its turn upon chalk, which provides good natural
drainage.”</p>

<p>The part of the field devoted to the experiments was divided into 24
plots, about the fifth of an acre each.</p>

<p>Two plots were left without manure of any kind.</p>

<p>One plot was manured every year with 14 tons per acre of farm-yard
manure, and the other plots “with manures,” to quote Dr. Gilbert, “which
respectively supplied certain constituents of farm-yard manure,
separately or in combination.”</p>

<p>In England, the best barley soils are usually lighter than the best
wheat soils. This is probably due to the fact that barley usually
follows a crop of turnips&mdash;more or less of which are eaten off on
the land by sheep. The trampling of the sheep compresses the soil, and
makes even a light, sandy one firmer in texture.</p>

<p>In this country, our best wheat land is also our best barley land,
<i>provided</i> it is in good heart, and is very thoroughly worked.
<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<a name = "page228" id = "page228"> </a>
It is no use sowing barley on heavy land half worked. It will do better
on light soils; but if the clayey soils are made fine and mellow, they
produce with us the best barley.</p>

<p>In chemical composition, barley is quite similar to wheat. Mr. Lawes
and Dr. Gilbert give the composition of a wheat-crop of 30 bushels per
acre, 1,800 lbs. of grain, and 3,000 lbs. of straw; and of a crop of
barley, 40 bushels per acre, 2,080 lbs. grain, and 2,500 lbs. of straw,

<p>A few years ago, when the midge destroyed our wheat, many farmers in
Western New York raised “winter barley,” instead of “winter wheat,” and
I have seen remarkably heavy crops of this winter barley. It is not now
grown with us. The maltsters would not pay as much for it as for spring
barley, and as the midge troubles us less, our farmers are raising
winter wheat again.</p>

<p>Where, as with us, we raise winter wheat and spring barley, the
difference between the two crops, taking the above estimate of yield and
proportion of grain to straw, would be:</p>

<p>1st. Almost identical composition in regard to nitrogen, phosphoric
acid, potash, lime, and magnesia; but as it has more straw, the
wheat-crop removes a larger amount of silica than barley.</p>

<p>2d. The greatest difference is in the length of time the two crops
are in the ground. We sow our winter wheat the last of August, or the
first and second week in September. Before winter sets in, the
wheat-plant often throws out a bunch of roots a foot in length. During
the winter, though the thermometer goes down frequently to zero, and
sometimes 10° to 15° below zero, yet if the land is well covered with
snow, it is not improbable that the roots continue to absorb more or
less food from the ground, and store it up for future use. In the
spring, the wheat commences to grow before we can get the barley into
the ground, though not to any considerable extent. I&nbsp;have several
times sown barley as soon as the surface-soil was thawed out five or six
inches deep, but with a bed of solid frozen earth beneath.</p>

<p>3d. Two-rowed barley does not ripen as early as winter wheat, but our
ordinary six-rowed barley is ready to harvest the same time as our
winter wheat.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">229</span>
<a name = "page229" id = "page229"> </a>
4th. We sow our barley usually in May, and harvest it in July. The
barley, therefore, has to take up its food rapidly. If we expect a good
growth, we must provide a good supply of food, and have it in the proper
condition for the roots to reach it and absorb it; in other words, the
land must be not only rich, but it must be so well worked that the roots
can spread out easily and rapidly in search of food and water. In this
country, you will find ten good wheat-growers to one good barley
grower.</p>

<p>“That is so,” said the Deacon; “but tell us about Mr. Lawes’
experiments. I&nbsp;have more confidence in them than in your
speculations. And first of all what kind of land was the barley grown
on?”</p>

<p>“It is,” said I, “rather heavy land&mdash;as heavy as what the men
call ‘clay-spots,’ on my farm.”</p>

<p>“And on those clay-spots,” said the Deacon, “you either get very good
barley, or a crop not worth harvesting.”</p>

<p>“You have hit it exactly, Deacon,” said I. “The best barley I have
this year (1878) is on these clay-spots. And the reason is, that we gave
them an extra plowing last fall with a three-horse plow. That extra
plowing has probably given me an extra 30 bushels of barley per acre.
The barley on some of the lighter portions of the field will not yield
over 25 bushels per acre. On the clay-spots, it looks now (June 13) as
though there would be over 50 bushels per acre. It is all headed out
handsomely on the clay-spots, and has a strong, dark, luxuriant
appearance, while on the sand, the crop is later and has a yellow,
sickly look.”</p>

<p>“You ought,” said the Doctor, “to have top-dressed these poor, sandy
parts of the field with a little superphosphate and nitrate of
soda.”</p>

<p>“It would have paid wonderfully well,” said I, “or, perhaps, more
correctly speaking, the loss would have been considerably less. We have
recently been advised by a distinguished writer, to apply manure to our
best land, and let the poor land take care of itself. But where the poor
land is in the same field with the good, we are obliged to plow, harrow,
cultivate, sow, and harvest the poor spots, and the question is, whether
we shall make them capable of producing a good crop by the application
of manure, or be at all the labor and expense of putting in and
harvesting a crop of chicken-feed and weeds. Artificial manures give us
a grand chance to make our crops more uniform.”</p>

<p>“You are certainly right there,” said the Doctor, “but let us examine
the Rothamsted experiments on barley.”</p>

<p>You will find the results in the following tables. The manures
<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
<a name = "page230" id = "page230"> </a>
used, are in many respects the same as were adopted in the wheat
experiments already given. The mineral or ash constituents were supplied
as follows:</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Potash</i>&mdash;as sulphate of potash.</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Soda</i>&mdash;as sulphate of soda.</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Magnesia</i>&mdash;as sulphate of magnesia.</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Lime</i>&mdash;as sulphate, phosphate, and
superphosphate.</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Phosphoric acid</i>&mdash;as bone-ash, mixed
with sufficient sulphuric acid to convert most of the insoluble earthy
phosphate of lime into sulphate and soluble superphosphate of lime.</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Sulphuric acid</i>&mdash;in the phosphatic
mixture just mentioned; in sulphates of potash, soda, and magnesia; in
sulphate of ammonia, etc.</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Chlorine</i>&mdash;in muriate of ammonia.</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Silica</i>&mdash;as artificial silicate of
soda.</p>

<p>Other constituents were supplied as under:</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Nitrogen</i>&mdash;as sulphate and muriate of
ammonia; as nitrate of soda; in farm-yard manure; in rape-cake.</p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Non-nitrogenous organic matter, yielding by
decomposition, carbonic acid, and other products</i>&mdash;in yard
manure, in rape-cake.</p>

<p>The artificial manure or mixture for each plot was ground up, or
otherwise mixed, with a sufficient quantity of soil and turf-ashes to
make it up to a convenient measure for equal distribution over the land.
The mixtures so prepared were, with proper precautions, sown broadcast
by hand; as it has been found that the application of an exact amount of
manure, to a limited area of land, can be best accomplished in that
way.</p>

<p>The same manures were used on the same plot each year. Any exceptions
to this rule are mentioned in foot-notes.</p>

<p>“That shows,” said the Deacon, “that a dressing of 50 lbs. per acre
pays better than a dressing of 100 lbs. per acre. I&nbsp;wish Mr. Lawes
had sown 75 lbs. on one plot.”</p>

<p>I wish so, too, but it is quite probable that in our climate, 50 lbs.
of available ammonia per acre is all that it will usually be profitable
to apply per acre to the barley crop. It is equal to a dressing of 500
lbs. guaranteed Peruvian guano, or 275 lbs. nitrate of soda. &mdash;“Or
to how much manure?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>To about 5 tons of average stable-manure, or say three tons of good,
well-rotted manure from grain-fed animals.</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the Deacon, “Mr. Lawes put on 14 tons of yard manure
per acre, and the yield of barley was not as much as from the 50 lbs. of
ammonia alone. How do you account for that?”</p>

<p>Simply because the ammonia in the manure is <i>not</i> ammonia. It is
what the chemists used to call “potential ammonia.” A good deal of it is
in the form of undigested straw and hay. The nitrogenous matter of the
food which has been digested by the animal
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<a name = "page241" id = "page241"> </a>
and thrown off in the liquid excrements, is in such a form that it will
readily ferment and produce ammonia, while the nitrogenous matter in the
undigested food and in the straw used for bedding, decomposes slowly
even under the most favorable conditions; and if buried while fresh in a
clay soil, it probably would not all decompose in many years. But we
will not discuss this at present.</p>

<p>“The superphosphate does not seem to have done much good,” said the
Deacon; “3½ cwt. per acre gives an increase of less than two bushels per
acre. And I suppose it was <i>good</i> superphosphate.”</p>

<p>There need be no doubt on that point. Better superphosphate of lime
cannot be made. But you must recollect that this is pure superphosphate
made from burnt bones. It contains no ammonia or organic matter.
Commercial superphosphates contain more or less ammonia, and had they
been used in these experiments, they would have shown a better result
than the pure article. They would have done good in proportion to the
available nitrogen they contained. If these experiments prove anything,
they clearly indicate that superphosphate alone is a very poor manure
for either wheat or barley.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> year, the unmanured plot gave 25¾ bushels per acre.
Potash, soda, and magnesia, (or what the Deacon calls “ashes,”) 27⅝
bushels; superphosphate 33½, and “ashes” and superphosphate, nearly 36
bushels per acre.</p>

<p>50 lbs. of ammonia, alone, gives nearly 39 bushels, and ammonia and
superphosphate together, 40 bushels.</p>

<p>The superphosphate and “ashes” give a better account of themselves
this year; but it is remarkable that the ammonia alone, gives almost as
good a crop as the ammonia and superphosphate, and a <i>better</i> crop
than the ammonia and “ashes,” or the ammonia, superphosphate, and ashes,
together.</p>

<p>The 14 tons farm-yard manure gives over 36 bushels per acre. This
plot has now had 28 tons of manure per acre, yet the 50 lbs. of ammonia
alone, still gives a better yield than this heavy dressing of
manure.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> season (1854), was quite favorable for the ripening
of wheat and barley. The seed on the experimental barley-field, was sown
Feb. 24, and the harvest was late; so that the crop had an unusually
long season for growth. It was one of the years when even poor land, if
clean, gives a good crop. The unmanured plot, it will be seen, yielded
over 35 bushels per acre of dressed grain, weighing over 53½ lbs. per
bushel. The total weight of grain, was 1,963 lbs. This is over 40
bushels per acre, of 48 lbs. per bushel, which is the standard with
us.</p>

<p>If you buy nitrate of soda at 3¾ cents a lb., the ammonia will cost
20 cents a lb. In the above experiment, 50 lbs. of ammonia, costing $10,
gives an increase of 16⅔ bushels of barley, and nearly half a ton of
straw. If the straw is worth $4.00 per ton, the barley will cost 48
cents a bushel.</p>

<p>Double the quantity of manure, costing $20, gives an increase of 28
bushels of barley, and over one ton of straw. In this case the extra
barley costs 57 cents a bushel.</p>

<p>On plot 2<i>a.</i>, 50 lbs. of ammonia and 3½ cwt. of superphosphate,
give 3,437 lbs. of grain, equal to 71½ of our bushels per acre.</p>

<p>On plot 2<i>a.a.</i>, 100 lbs. of ammonia and 3½ cwt. of
superphosphate, give 3,643 lbs. of grain, which lacks only 5 lbs. of 76
bushels per acre, and nearly 2½ tons of straw.</p>

<p>“That will do,” said the Deacon, “but I see that in 1857, this same
plot, with the same manure, produced 66½ bushels of dressed grain per
acre, weighing 53½ lbs. to the bushel, or a total weight of 3,696 lbs.,
equal to just 77 of our bushels per acre.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said the Doctor, “this same year, the plot which had 84
tons of farm-yard manure per acre, produced only 2,915 lbs. of grain, or
less than 61 of our bushels of barley per acre.”</p>

<p>The Squire happened in at this time, and heard the last remark. “What
are you saying,” he remarked, “about <i>only</i> 61 bushels of barley
per acre. I&nbsp;should like to see such a crop. Last year, in this
neighborhood, there were hundreds of acres of barley that did not yield
20 bushels per acre, and very little of it would weigh 44 lbs. to the
bushel.”</p>

<p>This is true. And the maltsters find it almost impossible to get
six-rowed barley weighing 48 lbs. per bushel. They told me, that they
would pay $1.10 per bushel for good bright barley weighing 48 lbs. per
bushel, and for each pound it weighed less than this, they deducted 10
cents a bushel from the price. In other words,
<span class = "pagenum">243</span>
<a name = "page243" id = "page243"> </a>
they would pay $1.00 a bushel for barley weighing 47 lbs. to the bushel;
90 cents for barley weighing 46 lbs.; 80 cents for barley weighing 45
lbs., and 70 cents for barley weighing 44 lbs.&mdash;and at these
figures they much preferred the heaviest barley.</p>

<p>It is certainly well worth our while, if we raise barley at all, to
see if we cannot manage not only to raise larger crops per acre, but to
produce barley of better quality. And these wonderful experiments of Mr.
Lawes are well worth careful examination and study.</p>

<p>The Squire put on his spectacles and looked at the tables of
figures.</p>

<p>“Like everybody else,” said he, “you pick out the big figures, and to
hear you talk, one would think you scientific gentlemen never have any
poor crops, and yet I see that in 1860, there are three different crops
of only 12⅛, 12¼, and 13¼ bushels per acre.”</p>

<p>“Those,” said I, “are the three plots which have grown barley every
year without any manure, and you have selected the worst year of the
whole twenty.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” said the Squire, “but we have got to take the bad with
the good, and I have often heard you say that a good farmer who has his
land rich and clean makes more money in an unfavorable than in a
favorable season. Now, this year 1860, seems to have been an unfavorable
one, and yet your pet manure, superphosphate, only gives an
<i>increase</i> of 148 lbs. of barley&mdash;or three bushels and 4 lbs.
Yet this plot has had a tremendous dressing of 3½ cwt. of superphosphate
yearly since 1852. I&nbsp;always told you you lost money in buying
superphosphate.”</p>

<p>“That depends on what you do with it. I&nbsp;use it for turnips, and
tomatoes, cabbages, lettuce, melons, cucumbers, etc., and would not like
to be without it; but I have never recommended any one to use it on
wheat, barley, oats, Indian corn, or potatoes, except as an experiment.
What I have recommended you to get for barley is, nitrate of soda, and
superphosphate, or Peruvian guano. And you will see that even in this
decidedly unfavorable season, the plot 2<i>a.a.</i>, dressed with
superphosphate and 275 lbs. of nitrate of soda, produced 2,338 lbs. of
barley, or 48¾ bushels per acre. This is an <i>increase</i> over the
unmanured plots of 33½ bushels per acre, and an <i>increase</i> of 1,872
lbs. of straw. And the plot dressed with superphosphate and 200 lbs. of
salts of ammonia, gave equally as good results.”</p>

<p>And this, mark you, is the year which the Squire selected as the one
most likely to show that artificial manures did not pay.</p>

<p>“I never knew a man except you,” said the Squire, “who wanted
unfavorable seasons.”</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">244</span>
<a name = "page244" id = "page244"> </a>
I have never said I wanted unfavorable seasons. I&nbsp;should not dare
to say so, or even to cherish the wish for one moment. But I do say,
that when we have a season so favorable that even poorly worked land
will produce a fair crop, we are almost certain to have prices below the
average cost of production. But when we have an unfavorable season, such
crops as barley, potatoes, and beans, often advance to extravagantly
high prices, and the farmer who has good crops in such a season, gets
something like adequate pay for his patient waiting, and for his efforts
to improve his land.</p>

<p>“That sounds all very well,” said the Squire, “but will it pay to use
these artificial manures?”</p>

<p>I do not wish to wander too much from the point, but would like to
remark before I answer that question, that I am not a special advocate
of artificial manures. I&nbsp;think we can often make manures on our
farms far cheaper than we can buy them. But as the Squire has asked the
question, and as he has selected from Mr. Lawes’ results, the year 1860,
I&nbsp;will meet him on his own ground. He has selected a season
specially unfavorable for the growth of barley. Now, in such an
unfavorable year in this country, barley would be likely to bring, at
least, $1.25 per bushel, and in a favorable season not over 75 cents a
bushel.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawes keeps his land <i>clean</i>, which is more than can be said
of many barley-growers. And in this unfavorable season of 1860, he gets
on his three unmanured plots an average of 730 lbs. of barley, equal to
15¼ bushels per acre, and not quite 800 lbs. of straw.</p>

<p>Many of our farmers frequently do no better than this. And you must
recollect that in such careful experiments as those of Mr. Lawes and Dr.
Gilbert, great pains would be taken to get all the barley that grew on
the land. With us, barley is cut with a reaper, and admirable as our
machines are, it is not an easy matter to cut a light, spindling crop of
barley perfectly clean. Then, in pitching the crop and drawing it in,
more or less barley is scattered, and even after we have been over the
field two or three times with a steel-tooth rake, there is still
considerable barley left on the ground. I&nbsp;think we may safely
assume that at least as much barley is left on the ground as we usually
sow&mdash;say two bushels per acre. And so, instead of having 15¼
bushels per acre, as Mr. Lawes had, we should only harvest 13¼
bushels.</p>

<p>Of all our ordinary farm crops, barley is attended with the least
labor and expense. We usually sow it after corn or potatoes. On such
strong land as that of Mr. Lawes, we ought to plow the land
<span class = "pagenum">245</span>
<a name = "page245" id = "page245"> </a>
in the autumn and again in the spring, or at least stir up the land
thoroughly with a two or three-horse cultivator or gang-plow.</p>

<p>Let us say that the cost of plowing, harrowing, drilling, and
rolling, is $5.00 per acre. Seed, $2.00. Harvesting, $2.00. Threshing, 6
cents a bushel.</p>

<p>“That is a better showing than I expected,” said the Squire, “and as

it, we cannot expect large profits.”</p>

<p>In ordinary farm practice, I feel sure we can do better than this.
Growing barley year after year on the same land, is not the most
economical way of getting the full value of the manure. There is much
nitrogen and phosphoric acid left in the land, which barley or even
wheat does not seem capable of taking up, but which would probably be of
great benefit to the clover.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">246</span>

<h6 class = "section">MANURE AND ROTATION OF CROPS.</h6>

<p>The old notion that there is any real chemical necessity for a
rotation of crops is unfounded. Wheat can be grown after wheat, and
barley after barley, and corn after corn, provided we use the necessary
manures and get the soil clean and in the right mechanical
condition.</p>

<p>“What, then, do we gain by a rotation?” asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>Much every way. A good rotation enables us to clean the land. We can
put in different crops at different seasons.</p>

<p>“So we could,” broke in the Deacon, “if we sowed wheat after wheat,
barley after barley, and corn after corn.”</p>

<p>True, but if we sowed winter-wheat after winter-wheat, there would
not be time enough to clean the land.</p>

<p>“Just as much as when we sow wheat after oats, or peas, or
barley.”</p>

<p>“True again, Deacon,” I replied, “but we are supposed to have cleaned
the land while it was in corn the previous year. I&nbsp;say supposed,
because in point of fact, many of our farmers do not half clean their
land while it is in corn. It is the weak spot in our agriculture. If our
land was as clean as it should be to start with, there is no rotation so
convenient in this section, as corn the first year, barley, peas, or
oats the second year, followed by winter-wheat seeded down. But to carry
out this rotation to the best advantage we need artificial manures.”</p>

<p>“But will they pay?” asks the Deacon.</p>

<p>“They will pay well, provided we can get them at a fair price and get
fair prices for our produce. If we could get a good superphosphate made
from Charleston phosphates for 1½ cent per lb., and nitrate of soda for
3½ or 4 cents per lb., and the German potash-salts for ¾ cent per lb.,
and could get on the average $1.25 per bushel for barley, and $1.75 for
good white wheat, we could use these manures to great advantage.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like barn-yard manure,” says the Deacon.</p>

<p>No doubt on that point, provided it is good manure. Barn-yard manure,
whether rich or poor, contains all the elements of plant-food, but there
is a great difference between rich and poor manure. The rich manure
contains twice or three times as much nitrogen and phosphoric acid as
ordinary or poor manure. And this is the reason why artificial manures
are valuable in proportion to the nitrogen and phosphoric acid that they
contain in an available condition. When we use two or three hundred
pounds per acre of a good artificial manure we in effect, directly or
indirectly, convert
<span class = "pagenum">247</span>
<a name = "page247" id = "page247"> </a>
poor manure into rich manure. There is manure in our soil, but it is
poor. There is manure in our barn-yard, but it is poor also. Nitrogen
and phosphoric acid will make these manures rich. This is the reason why
a few pounds of a good artificial manure will produce as great an effect
as tons of common manure. Depend upon it, the coming farmer will avail
himself of the discoveries of science, and will use more artificial
fertilizers.</p>

<p>But whether we use artificial fertilizers or farm-yard manure, we
shall not get the full effect of the manures unless we adopt a judicious
rotation of crops.</p>

<p>When we sow wheat after wheat, or barley after barley, or oats after
oats, we certainly do not get the full effect of the manures used. Mr.
Lawes’ experiments afford conclusive evidence on this point. You will
recollect that in 1846, one of the plots of wheat (10<i>b</i>), which
had received a liberal dressing of salts of ammonia the year previous,
was left without manure, and the yield of wheat on this plot was no
greater than on the plot which was continuously unmanured. In other
words, <i>the ammonia which was left in the soil from the previous year,
had no effect on the wheat</i>.</p>

<p>The following table shows the amount of nitrogen furnished by the
manure, and the amount recovered in the crop, when wheat is grown after
wheat for a series of years, and also when barley is grown after barley,
and oats after oats.</p>

It is not necessary to make any comments on this table. It speaks for
itself; but it does not tell half the story. For instance, in the case
of wheat and barley, it gives the average result for 20 years. It shows
that when 100 lbs. of nitrogen in a soluble and available form, are
applied to wheat, about 68 lbs. are <i>left in the soil</i>. But you
must recollect that 100 lbs. was applied again the next year, and no
account is taken of the 68 lbs. left in the soil&mdash;and so on for 20
years. In other words, on plot 8, for instance, 2,460 lbs. of nitrogen
have been applied, and only 775 lbs. have been recovered in the total
produce of grain, straw, and chaff, and 1,685 lbs. have been left in the
soil.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawes estimates, from several analyses, that his farm-yard manure
contains 0.637 per cent of nitrogen, 2.76 per cent of mineral matter,
and 27.24 per cent of organic matter, and 70 per cent of water.</p>

<p>According to this, the plot dressed with 14 tons of manure every
year, for 20 years, has received 3,995 lbs. of nitrogen, of which 583¼
lbs. were recovered in the produce, and 3,411¾ lbs. were left in the
soil.</p>

<p>In the case of barley, 3,995 lbs. of nitrogen was applied during the
20 years to the plot dressed with farm-yard manure, of which 427½ lbs.
were recovered in the crop, and 3,567½ lbs. left in the soil.</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Deacon, “that barley gets less of the goodness out
of farm-yard manure than wheat, but that it gets more out of the salts
of ammonia and nitrate of soda. How do you account for that?”</p>

<p>“I suppose, because the manure for wheat was applied in the autumn,
and the rains of winter and spring dissolved more of the plant-food than
would be the case if the manure was applied in the spring. If the manure
had been applied on the surface, instead of plowing it under,
I&nbsp;believe the effect would have been still more in favor of the
autumn-manuring.”</p>

<p>When the nitrogen is in an available condition, spring barley can
take up and utilize a larger proportion of the nitrogen than winter
wheat. Neither the wheat nor the barley can get at and take up half what
is applied, and this, notwithstanding the fact that a heavy dew or a
slight rain furnishes water enough on an acre to dissolve a liberal
dressing of nitrate of soda or sulphate and muriate of ammonia. The
truth is, the soil is very conservative. It does not, fortunately for
us, yield up all its plant-food in a year.</p>

<p>We have seen that when wheat or barley is dressed with soluble
<span class = "pagenum">250</span>
<a name = "page250" id = "page250"> </a>
ammonia-salts or nitrate of soda, a&nbsp;considerable amount of the
nitrogen is left in the soil&mdash;and yet this nitrogen is of
comparatively little benefit to the succeeding crops of wheat or barley,
while a fresh dressing of ammonia-salts or nitrate of soda is of great
benefit to the crop.</p>

<p>In other words, when wheat is sown after wheat, or barley after
barley, we do not get half the benefit from the manure which it is
theoretically capable of producing.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Now, the question is, whether by a judicious rotation of crops, we
can avoid this great loss of manure?</p>

<p>There was a time when it was thought that the growth of turnips
enriched the soil. I&nbsp;have heard it said, again and again, that the
reason English farmers grow larger crops of wheat and barley than we do,
is because they grow so many acres of turnips.</p>

<p>“So I have often heard,” said the Deacon, “and I supposed the broad
turnip leaves absorbed nitrogen from the atmosphere.”</p>

<p>There is no evidence that leaves have any such power; while there are
many facts which point in an opposite direction. The following
experiments of Lawes and Gilbert seem to show that the mere growth of
turnips does not enrich land for grain crops.</p>

<p>Turnips were grown on the same land, year after year, for ten years.
The land was then plowed and sown to barley for three years. The
following table gives the results:</p>

<p>The yield of barley after turnips is less than it is after grain
crops, and it is evident that this is due to a lack of available
nitrogen
<span class = "pagenum">251</span>
<a name = "page251" id = "page251"> </a>
in the soil. In other words, the turnips leave <i>less</i> available
nitrogen in the soil than grain crops.</p>

<p>After alluding to the facts given in the foregoing table, Messrs.
Lawes and Gilbert say:</p>

<p>“There is evidence of another kind that may be cited as showing that
it was of available nitrogen that the turnips had rendered the soil so
deficient for the after-growth of barley. It may be assumed that, on the
average, between 25 and 30 lbs. of nitrogen would be annually removed
from the Rothamsted soil by wheat or barley grown year after year
without nitrogenous manure. But it is estimated that from the
mineral-manured turnip-plots there were, over the 10 years, more than 50
lbs. of nitrogen per acre per annum removed. As, however, on some of the
plots, small quantities of ammonia-salts or rape-cake were applied in
the first two years of the ten of turnips, it is, perhaps, more to the
purpose to take the average over the last 8 years of turnips only; and
this would show about 45 lbs. of nitrogen removed per acre per annum. An
immaterial proportion of this might be due to the small amounts of
nitrogenous manures applied in the first two years. Still, it may be
assumed that about 1½ time as much nitrogen was removed from the land
for 8, if not for 10 years, in succession, as would have been taken in
an equal number of crops of wheat or barley grown without nitrogenous
manure. No wonder, then, that considerably less barley has been grown in
3 years after a series of mineral-manured turnip-crops, than was
obtained in another field after a less number of corn-crops.</p>

<p>“The results obtained in Barn-field afford a striking illustration of
the dependence of the turnip-plant on a supply of available nitrogen
within the soil, and of its comparatively great power of exhausting it.
They are also perfectly consistent with those in Hoos-field, in showing
that mineral manures will not yield fair crops of barley, unless there
be, within the soil, a&nbsp;liberal supply of available nitrogen. The
results obtained under such very different conditions in the two fields
are, in fact, strikingly mutually confirmatory.”</p>

<h5>MANURES FOR OATS.</h5>

<p>“What is the use of talking about manure for oats,” said the Deacon,
“if land is not rich enough to produce oats without manure, it certainly
will not pay to manure them. We can use our manure on some crop that
will pay better.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely what we want to know,” said I. “Very likely you
are right, but have you any evidence?”</p>

<p>“Evidence of what?”</p>

<p>“Have you any facts that show, for instance, that it will pay better
to use manure for wheat or barley than for oats?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say that I have, but I think manure will pay better on wheat
than on oats.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lawes is making a series of experiments on oats. Let us take a
hasty glance at the results of the first two seasons:</p>

<p>It seems clear that, for oats, as for barley and wheat, what we most
need in manure, is available nitrogen.</p>

<p>The first year, the no-manure plot produced 36⅝ bushels of oats per
acre, weighing 36¾ lbs. per bushel, and plot 3, with ammonia-salts
alone, 56⅛ bushels, and with nitrate of soda alone, on plot 5, 62¼
bushels per acre, both weighing 38½ lbs. per bushel. In other words, 82
lbs. of available nitrogen in the salts of ammonia gave an increase of
about 20 bushels per acre, and the same quantity of nitrogen in nitrate
of soda an increase of 26 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>The next year, the season seems to have been a very unfavorable
<span class = "pagenum">253</span>
<a name = "page253" id = "page253"> </a>
one for oats. The no-manure plot produced less than 17 bushels per acre;
and the “ashes” and superphosphate on plot 2, give an increase of less
than 3 bushels per acre. But it will be seen that on plot 3 the
ammonia-salts do as much good in this unfavorable season as in the
favorable one. They give an increase of over 20 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>“A few such facts as this,” said the Deacon, “would almost persuade
me that you are right in contending that it is in the unfavorable
seasons, when prices are sure to be high in this country, that a good
farmer stands the best chance to make money.”</p>

<p>“Where mixed alkalies and superphosphate,” said the Doctor, “are
added to the ammonia, the increase <i>from the ammonia</i> is far
greater than where ammonia is used alone. In other words, by comparing
plot 2 and plot 4, you will see that the ammonia gives an increase of
30¼ bushels per acre in 1869, and 31½ bushels in 1870.”</p>

<p>The truth of the matter probably is this: 100 lbs. of available
ammonia per acre is an excessive supply, when used alone. And in fact
Mr. Lawes himself only recommends about half this quantity.</p>

<p>Whether it will pay us to use artificial manures on oats depends on
the price we are likely to get for the oats. When the price of oats
<i>per lb.</i> and oat-straw is as high as barley and barley-straw
<i>per lb.</i>, then it will pay a <i>little better</i> to use manure on
oats than on barley. As a rule in this country, however, good barley is
worth more per lb. than good oats; and it will usually pay better to use
artificial manures on barley than on oats.</p>

<p>Some years ago Mr. Bath, of Virginia, made some experiments on oats
with the following results:</p>

<p>The oats were sown March 13, and the crop harvested July 4.</p>

<p>In 1860, I made some experiments with gypsum, superphosphate, and
sulphate of ammonia as a top-dressing on oats.</p>

<p>The land was a clover-sod, plowed about the middle of May, and the
oats sown May 20. On the 26th of May, just as the oats were coming up,
the manures were sown broadcast. The oats were sown too late to obtain
the best results. On another field, where the oats were sown two weeks
earlier, the crop was decidedly better. The oats were cut August 28.</p>

<p>These experiments were made when my land was not as clean as it is
now. I&nbsp;presume the weeds got more benefit from the ammonia than the
oats. To top-dress foul land with expensive artificial manures is money
thrown away. If the land had been plowed in the autumn, and the seed and
manures could have been put in early in the spring, I&nbsp;presume we
should have had more favorable results.</p>

<p>“Are you not ashamed to acknowledge,” said the Deacon, “that you have
ever raised oats weighing only 22 lbs. per bushel.”</p>

<p>No. I have raised even worse crops than this&mdash;and so has the
Deacon. But I made up my mind that such farming did not pay, and I have
been trying hard since then to clean my land and get it into better
condition. And until this is done, it is useless to talk much of
artificial manures.</p>

<p>The most striking result is the effect of the gypsum. It not only
gave an increased yield of 11 bushels per acre, but the oats were of
decidedly better quality, and there was nearly half a ton more straw per
acre than on the plot alongside, where no manure was used.</p>

<p>The superphosphate was a good article, similar to that used in Mr.
Lawes’ experiments.</p>

CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h4>

<h5>MANURES FOR POTATOES.</h5>

<p>Some time ago, a farmer in Pennsylvania wrote me that he wanted “to
raise a first-rate crop of potatoes.” I answered him as follows through
the <i>American Agriculturist</i>:</p>

<p>“There are many ways of doing this. But as you only enter on the farm
this spring, you will work to disadvantage. To obtain the best results,
it is necessary to prepare for the crop two or three years beforehand.
All that you can do this year is to select the best land on the farm,
put on 400 lbs. of Peruvian guano, cultivate thoroughly, and suffer not
a weed to grow. A&nbsp;two or three-year-old clover-sod, on warm, rich,
sandy loam, gives a good chance for potatoes. Do not plow until you are
ready to plant. Sow the guano broadcast after plowing, and harrow it in,
or apply a tablespoonful in each hill, and mix it with the soil. Mark
out the rows, both ways, three feet apart, and drop a fair-sized potato
in each hill. Start the cultivator as soon as the rows can be
distinguished, and repeat every week or ten days until there is danger
of disturbing the roots. We usually hill up a little, making a broad,
flat hill. A&nbsp;tablespoonful of plaster, dusted on the young plants
soon after they come up, will usually do good. We recommend guano,
because in our experience it does not increase the rot. But it is only
fair to add, that we have not found even barn-yard manure, if thoroughly
rotted and well mixed with the soil the fall previous, half so injurious
as some people would have us suppose. If any one will put 25 loads per
acre on our potato land, we will agree to plant and run the risk of the
rot. But we would use some guano as well. The truth is, that it is
useless to expect a large crop of potatoes, say 350 bushels per acre,
without plenty of manure.”</p>

<p>This was written before the potato-beetle made its appearance. But I
think I should say the same thing now&mdash;only put it a little
stronger. The truth is, it will not pay to “fight the bugs” on a poor
crop of potatoes. We must select the best land we have and make it as
rich as possible.</p>

<p>“But why do you recommend Peruvian guano,” asked the Doctor, “rather
than superphosphate or ashes? Potatoes contain a large amount of potash,
and one would expect considerable benefit from an application of
ashes.”</p>

<p>“Ashes, plaster, and hen-dung,” said the Judge, “will at any rate
<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<a name = "page256" id = "page256"> </a>
pay well on potatoes. I&nbsp;have tried this mixture again and again,
and always with good effect.”</p>

<p>“I believe in the hen-dung,” said I, “and possibly in the plaster,
but on my land, ashes do not seem to be specially beneficial on
potatoes, while I have rarely used Peruvian guano without good effect;
and sometimes it has proved wonderfully profitable, owing to the high
price of potatoes.”</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Sometime ago, I had a visit from one of the most enterprising and
successful farmers in Western New York.</p>

<p>“What I want to learn,” he said, “is how to make manure enough to
keep my land in good condition. I&nbsp;sell nothing but beans, potatoes,
wheat, and apples. I&nbsp;feed out all my corn, oats, stalks, straw, and
hay on the farm, and draw into the barn-yard the potato-vines and
everything else that will rot into manure. I&nbsp;make a big pile of it.
But the point with me is to find out what is the best stock to feed this
straw, stalks, hay, oats, and corn to, so as to make the best manure and
return the largest profit. Last year I bought a lot of steers to feed in
winter, and lost money. This fall I bought 68 head of cows to winter,
intending to sell them in the spring.”</p>

<p>“What did they cost you?”</p>

<p>“I went into Wyoming and Cattaraugus Counties, and picked them up
among the dairy farmers, and selected a very fair lot of cows at an
average of $22 per head. I&nbsp;expect to sell them as new milch cows in
the spring. Such cows last spring would have been worth $60 to $70
each.”</p>

<p>“That will pay. But it is not often the grain-grower gets such a
chance to feed out his straw, stalks, and other fodder to advantage. It
cannot be adopted as a permanent system. It is bad for the dairyman, and
no real help to the grain-grower. The manure is not rich enough. Straw
and stalks alone can not be fed to advantage. And when you winter cows
to sell again in the spring, it will not pay to feed grain. If you were
going to keep the cows it would pay well. The fat and flesh you put on
in the winter would be returned in the form of butter and cheese next
summer.”</p>

<p>“Why is not the manure good? I am careful to save everything, and
expect seven or eight hundred loads of manure in the spring.”</p>

<p>“You had 60 acres of wheat that yielded 25 bushels per acre, and have
probably about 50 tons of wheat straw. You had also 30 acres oats, that
yielded 50 bushels per acre, say 35 tons of straw. Your 20 acres of corn
produced 40 bushels of shelled corn per acre; say the stalks weigh 30
tons. And you have 60 tons of
<span class = "pagenum">257</span>
<a name = "page257" id = "page257"> </a>
hay, half clover and half timothy. Let us see what your manure from this
amount of grain and fodder is worth.</p>

<p>“This is the value of the manure <i>on the land</i>. Assuming that
there are 600 loads, and that the labor of cleaning out the stables,
piling, carting, and spreading the manure is worth 30 cents per load, or
$180, we have $912.40 as the net value of the manure.</p>

<p>“Now, your 250-acre farm <i>might</i> be so managed that this amount
of manure annually applied would soon greatly increase its fertility.
But you do not think you can afford to summer-fallow, and you want to
raise thirty or forty acres of potatoes every year.”</p>

<p>“I propose to do so,” he replied. “Situated as I am, close to a good
shipping station, no crop pays me better. My potatoes this year have
averaged me over $100 per acre.”</p>

<p>“Very good. But it is perfectly clear to my mind that sooner or
later, you must either farm slower or feed higher. And in your case,
situated close to a village where you can get plenty of help, and with a
good shipping station near by, you had better adopt the latter plan. You
must feed higher, and make richer manure. You now feed out 213 tons of
stuff, and make 600 loads of manure, worth $912.40. By feeding out
<i>one third</i>, or 71 tons more, you can <i>more than double</i> the
value of the manure.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>I am well aware that comparatively few farmers in this section can
afford to adopt this plan of enriching their land. We want better stock.
I&nbsp;do not know where I could buy a lot of steers that it would pay
to fatten in the winter. Those farmers who raise good grade Shorthorn or
Devon cattle are not the men to sell them half-fat at low rates. They
can fatten them as well as I can. For some time to come, the farmer who
proposes to feed liberally,
<span class = "pagenum">258</span>
<a name = "page258" id = "page258"> </a>
will have to raise his own stock. He can rarely buy well-bred animals to
fatten. A&nbsp;good farmer must be a good farmer throughout. He can not
be good in spots. His land must be drained, well-worked, and free from
weeds. If he crops heavily he must manure heavily, and to do this he
must feed liberally&mdash;and he can not afford to feed liberally unless
he has good stock.</p>

<p>“I have, myself, no doubt but you are right on this point,” said the
Doctor, “but all this <i>takes time</i>. Suppose a farmer becomes
satisfied that the manure he makes is not rich enough. To tell him, when
he is anxious to raise a good crop of potatoes next year, that he must
go to work and improve his stock of cattle, sheep, and swine, and then
buy bran and oil-cake to make richer manure, is somewhat
tantalizing.”</p>

<p>This is true, and in such a case, instead of adding nitrogen and
phosphoric acid to his manure in the shape of bran, oil-cake, etc., he
can buy nitrogen and phosphoric acid in guano or in nitrate of soda and
superphosphate. This gives him richer manure; which is precisely what he
wants for his potatoes. His poor manure is not so much deficient in
potash as in nitrogen and phosphoric acid, and consequently it is
nitrogen and phosphoric acid that he will probably need to make his soil
capable of producing a large crop of potatoes.</p>

<p>I have seen Peruvian guano extensively used on potatoes, and almost
always with good effect. My first experience with it in this country,
was in 1852. Four acres of potatoes were planted on a two-year-old
clover-sod, plowed in the spring. On two acres, Peruvian guano was sown
broadcast at the rate of 300 lbs. per acre and harrowed in. The potatoes
were planted May 10. On the other two acres no manure of any kind was
used, though treated exactly alike in every other respect. The result
was as follows:</p>

<p>The guano cost, here, about 3 cents a lb., and consequently nine
dollars’ worth of guano gave 84 bushels of potatoes. The potatoes were
all sound and good, but where the guano was used, they were larger, with
scarcely a small one amongst them.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>In 1857, I made the following experiments on potatoes, in the same
field on which the preceding experiment was made in 1852.</p>

<p>In this case, as before, the land was a two-year-old clover-sod. It
was plowed about the first of May, and harrowed until it was in a good
mellow condition. The potatoes were planted in hills 3½

<p>The superphosphate of lime was made expressly for experimental
purposes, from calcined bones, ground fine, and mixed with sulphuric
acid in the proper proportions to convert all the phosphate of lime of
the bones into the soluble superphosphate. It was a purely mineral
article, free from ammonia and other organic matter. It cost about two
and a half cents per pound.</p>

<p>The manures were deposited in the hill, covered with an inch or two
of soil, and the seed then planted on the top. Where superphosphate of
lime or sulphate of ammonia was used in conjunction with ashes, the
ashes were first deposited in the hill and covered with a little soil,
and then the superphosphate or sulphate of ammonia placed on the top and
covered with soil before the seed was planted. Notwithstanding this
precaution, the rain washed the sulphate of ammonia into the ashes, and
decomposition, with loss of ammonia, was the result. This will account
for the less yield on plot 8 than on plot 2. It would have been better
to have sown the ashes broadcast, but some previous experiments with
Peruvian guano on potatoes indicated that it was best to apply guano in
the hill, carefully covering it with soil to prevent it injuring the
seed, than to sow it broadcast. It was for this reason, and for the
greater convenience in sowing, that the manures were applied in the
hill.</p>

<p>The ash of potatoes consists of about 50 per cent of potash, and this
fact has induced many writers to recommend ashes as a manure for this
crop. It will be seen, however, that in this instance, at
<span class = "pagenum">260</span>
<a name = "page260" id = "page260"> </a>
least, they have very little effect, 400 lbs. giving an increase of only
five bushels per acre. One hundred pounds of plaster per acre gave an
increase of six bushels. Plaster and ashes combined, an increase per
acre of 15 bushels.</p>

<p>One fact is clearly brought out by these experiments: that this soil,
which has been under cultivation without manure for many years, is not,
relatively to other constituents of crops, deficient in potash. Had such
been the case, the sulphate of ammonia and superphosphate of
lime&mdash;manures which contain no potash&mdash;would not have give a
an increase of 84 bushels of potatoes per acre. There was sufficient
potash in the soil, in an available condition, for 179 bushels of
potatoes per acre; and the reason why the soil without manure produced
only 95 bushels per acre, was owing to a deficiency of ammonia and
phosphates.</p>

<p>Since these experiments were made, Dr. Vœlcker and others have made
similar ones in England. The results on the whole all point in one
direction. They show that the manures most valuable for potatoes are
those rich in nitrogen and phosphoric acid, and that occasionally potash
is also a useful addition.</p>

<p>“There is one thing I should like to know,” said the Doctor.
“Admitting that nitrogen and phosphoric acid and potash are the most
important elements of plant-food, how many bushels of potatoes should we
be likely to get from a judicious application of these manures?”</p>

<p>“There is no way,” said I, “of getting at this with any degree of
certainty. The numerous experiments that have been made in England seem
to show that a given quantity of manure will produce a larger
<i>increase</i> on poor land than on land in better condition.”</p>

<p>In England potatoes are rarely if ever planted without manure, and
the land selected for this crop, even without manure, would usually be
in better condition than the average potato land of this section, and
consequently a given amount of manure, applied to potatoes here, would
be likely to do more good, up to a certain point, than the same amount
would in England.</p>

<p>Let us look at some of the experiments that have been made in
England:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of
Scotland for 1873 is a prize essay on “Experiments upon Potatoes, with
Potash Salts, on Light Land,” by Charles D. Hunter, F.C.S., made on the
farm of William Lawson, in Cumberland. Mr. Hunter “was charged with the
manuring of the farm and the purchasing of chemical manures to the
annual value of £2,000,” or say $10,000.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">261</span>
<a name = "page261" id = "page261"> </a>
“Potatoes,” says Mr. Hunter, “were largely grown on the farm, and in the
absence of a sufficiency of farm-yard manure, potash naturally suggested
itself as a necessary constituent of a chemical potato-manure. The soil
was light and gravelly, with an open subsoil, and the rainfall from 29
to 38 inches a year.”</p>

<p>The first series of experiments was made in 1867. The following are
some of the results:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That does not say much for potash and superphosphate,” said the
Deacon. “The superphosphate only produced four bushels more than the no
manure, and the potash and superphosphate only fifteen bushels more than
the superphosphate alone.”</p>

<p>It may be worth while mentioning that one of the experimental plots
this year was on a head-land, “where the cattle frequently stand for
shelter.” This plot was dressed with only eight and a half tons of
manure, and the crop was over 427 bushels per acre, while a plot
alongside, without manure, produced only 163 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>“That shows the importance,” said the Deacon, “of planting potatoes
on rich land, rather than to plant on poor land and try to make it rich
by applying manure directly to the crop.”</p>

<p>“Here again,” said the Doctor, “superphosphate and potash alone give
an increase of only forty-two bushels per acre, while on plot 2, where
two hundred weight of muriate of potash is substituted by two hundred
weight of sulphate of ammonia, the increase is 108 bushels per acre. It
certainly looks as though a manure for potatoes, so far as yield is
concerned, should be rich in available nitrogen.”</p>

<p>“This is a very interesting experiment,” said the Doctor.
“Superphosphate alone gives an increase of thirteen bushels.
Superphosphate and potash an increase of seventy-three bushels. The
potash, therefore, gives an increase of sixty bushels. Superphosphate
<i>and</i> ammonia give twelve bushels more than superphosphate alone,
and the reason it does not produce a better crop is owing to a
deficiency of potash. When this is supplied the ammonia gives an
increase (plots 5 and 6) of ninety-one bushels per acre.”</p>

<p>In 1870 the above experiments were repeated on the same land, with
the same general results.</p>

<p>In 1871 some experiments were made on a sharp, gravelly soil, which
had been over-cropped, and was in poor condition. The following are the

<p>“On this poor soil,” said the Doctor, “the ammonia and superphosphate
gave an increase of 116 bushels per acre; and 3½ hundred weight of
muriate of potash an increase, on one plot, of eighteen bushels, and on
the other nineteen bushels per acre.”</p>

<p>In the same year, 1871, another set of experiments was made on a
better and more loamy soil, which had been in grass for several years.
In 1869 it was sown for hay, and in 1870 was broken up and sown to oats,
and the next spring planted with potatoes. The following are some of the
results:</p>

<p>“It is curious,” said the Doctor, “that the plot with sulphate of
ammonia alone should produce less than the no-manure plot.”</p>

<p>“The sulphate of ammonia,” said I, “may have injured the seed, or it
may have produced too luxuriant a growth of vine.”</p>

<p>Another series of experiments was made on another portion of the same
field in 1871. The “no-manure” plot produced 337 bushels per acre.
Manures of various kinds were used, but the largest yield, 351 bushels
per acre, was from superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia; fourteen tons
barn-yard manure produce 340 bushels per acre; and Mr. Hunter remarks:
“It is evident that, when the produce of the unmanured soil reaches nine
tons [336 bushels] per acre, there is but little scope for manure of any
kind.”</p>

<p>“I do not see,” said the Doctor, “that you have answered my question,
but I suppose that, with potatoes at fifty cents a bushel, and wheat at
$1.50 per bushel, artificial manures can be more profitably used on
potatoes than on wheat, and the same is probably true of oats, barley,
corn, etc.”</p>

<p>I have long been of the opinion that artificial manures can be
applied to potatoes with more profit than to any other ordinary
farm-crop, for the simple reason that, in this country, potatoes, on the
average, command relatively high prices.</p>

<p>For instance, if average land, without manure, will produce fifteen
bushels of wheat per acre and 100 bushels of potatoes, and a given
quantity of manure costing, say $25, will double the crop, we have, in
the one case, <i>an increase</i> of:&mdash;</p>

The only question is, whether the same quantity of the right kind of
manure is as likely to double the potato crop as to double the wheat
crop, when both are raised on average land.</p>

<p>“It is not an easy matter,” said the Deacon, “to double the yield of
potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Neither is it,” said I, “to double the yield of wheat, but both can
be done, provided you start low enough. If your land is clean, and well
worked, and dry, and only produces ten bushels of wheat per acre, there
is no difficulty in making it produce twenty bushels; and so of
potatoes. If the land be dry and well cultivated, and, barring the bugs,
produces without manure 75 bushels per acre, there ought to be no
difficulty in making it produce 150 bushels.</p>

<p>“But if your land produces, without manure, 150 bushels, it is not
always easy to make it produce 300 bushels. Fortunately, or
unfortunately, our land is, in most cases, poor enough to start with,
and we ought to be able to use manure on potatoes to great
advantage.”</p>

<p>“But will not the manure,” asked the Deacon, “injure the quality of
the potatoes?”</p>

<p>I think not. So far as my experiments and experience go, the
judicious use of good manure, on dry land, favors the perfect maturity
of the tubers and the formation of starch. I&nbsp;never manured potatoes
so highly as I did last year (1877), and never had potatoes of such high
quality. They cook white, dry, and mealy. We made furrows two and a half
feet apart, and spread rich, well-rotted manure in the furrows, and
planted the potatoes on top of the manure, and covered them with a plow.
In our climate, I&nbsp;am inclined to think, it would be better to apply
the manure to the land for potatoes the autumn previous. If sod land,
spread the manure on the surface, and let it lie exposed all winter. If
stubble land, plow it in the fall, and then spread the manure in the
fall or winter, and plow it under in the spring.</p>

<h5>WHAT CROPS SHOULD MANURE BE APPLIED TO.</h5>

<p>“It will not do any harm on any crop,” said the Deacon, “but on my
farm it seems to be most convenient to draw it out in the winter or
spring, and plow it under for corn. I&nbsp;do not know any farmer except
you who uses it on potatoes.”</p>

<p>My own rule is to apply manure to those crops which require the most
labor per acre. But I am well aware that this rule will have many
exceptions. For instance, it will often pay well to use manure on
barley, and yet barley requires far less labor than corn or
potatoes.</p>

<p>People who let out, and those who work farms “on shares” seldom
understand this matter clearly. I&nbsp;knew a farmer, who last year let
out a field of good land, that had been in corn the previous year, to a
man to sow to barley, and afterwards to wheat on “the halves.” Another
part of the farm was taken by a man to plant corn and potatoes on
similar terms, and another man put in several acres of cabbage, beets,
carrots, and onions on halves. It never seemed to occur to either of
them that the conditions were unequal. The expense of digging and
harvesting the potato-crop alone was greater than the whole cost of the
barley-crop; while, after the barley was off, the land was plowed once,
harrowed, and sowed to winter wheat; and nothing more has to be done to
it until the next harvest. With the garden crops, the difference is even
still more striking. The labor expended on one acre of onions or carrots
would put in and harvest a ten-acre field of barley. If the tenant gets
pay for his labor, the landlord would get say $5 an acre for his barley
land, and $50 for his carrot and onion land. I&nbsp;am pretty sure the
tenants did not see the matter in this light, nor the farmer either.</p>

<p>Crops which require a large amount of labor can only be grown on very
rich land. Our successful market-gardeners, seed-growers, and nurserymen
understand this matter. They must get great crops or they cannot pay
their labor bill. And the principle is applicable to ordinary farm
crops. Some of them require much more labor than others, and should
never be grown unless the land is
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>
<a name = "page266" id = "page266"> </a>
capable of producing a maximum yield per acre, or a close approximation
to it. As a rule, the least-paying crops are those which require the
least labor per acre. Farmers are afraid to expend much money for labor.
They are wise in this, unless all the conditions are favorable. But when
they have land in a high state of cultivation&mdash;drained, clean,
mellow, and rich&mdash;it would usually pay them well to grow crops
which require the most labor.</p>

<p>And it should never be forgotten that, as compared with nearly all
other countries, our labor is expensive. No matter how cheap our land
may be, we can not afford to waste our labor. It is too costly. If men
would work for nothing, and board themselves, there are localities where
we could perhaps afford to keep sheep that shear two pounds of wool a
year; or cows that make 75 lbs. of butter. We might make a profit out of
a wheat crop of 8 bushels per acre, or a corn-crop of 15 bushels, or a
potato-crop of 50 bushels. But it cannot be done with labor costing from
$1.00 to $1.25 per day. And I do not believe labor will cost much less
in our time. The only thing we can do is to employ it to the best
advantage. Machinery will help us to some extent, but I can see no real
escape from our difficulties in this matter, except to raise larger
crops per acre.</p>

<p>In ordinary farming, “larger crops per acre” means fewer acres
planted or sown with grain. It means more summer fallow, more grass,
clover, peas, mustard, coleseed, roots, and other crops that are
consumed on the farm. It means more thorough cultivation. It means clean
and rich land. It means husbanding the ammonia and nitric acid, which is
brought to the soil, as well as that which is developed from the soil,
or which the soil attracts from the atmosphere, and using it to grow a
crop every second, third, or fourth year, instead of every year. If a
piece of land will grow 25 bushels of corn every year, we should aim to
so manage it, that it will grow 50 every other year, or 75 every third
year, or, if the <i>climate</i> is capable of doing it, of raising 100
bushels per acre every fourth year.</p>

<p>Theoretically this can be done, and in one of Mr. Lawes’ experiments
he did it practically in the case of a summer-fallow for wheat, the one
crop in two years giving a little more than two crops sown in
succession. But on sandy land we should probably lose a portion of the
liberated plant-food, unless we grew a crop of some kind every year. And
the matter organized in the renovating crop could not be rendered
completely available for the next crop. <i>In the end</i>, however, we
ought to be able to get it with little or no loss. How best to
accomplish this result, is one of the
<span class = "pagenum">267</span>
<a name = "page267" id = "page267"> </a>
most interesting and important fields for scientific investigation and
practical experiment. We know enough, however, to be sure that there is
a great advantage in waiting until there is a sufficient accumulation of
available plant-food in the soil to produce a large yield, before sowing
a crop that requires much labor.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>If we do not want to wait, we must apply manure. If we have no
barn-yard or stable-manure, we must buy artificials.</p>


<h6 class = "section">HOW AND WHEN MANURE SHOULD BE APPLIED.</h6>

<p>This is not a merely theoretical or chemical question. We must take
into consideration the <i>cost</i> of application. Also, whether we
apply it at a busy or a leisure season. I&nbsp;have seen it recommended,
for instance, to spread manure on meadow-land immediately after the
hay-crop was removed. Now, I&nbsp;think this may be theoretically very
good advice. But, on my farm, it would throw the work right into the
midst of wheat and barley harvests; and I should make the theory bend a
little to my convenience. The meadows would have to wait until we had
got in the crops&mdash;or until harvest operations were stopped by
rain.</p>

<p>I mention this merely to show the complex character of this question.
On my own farm, the most leisure season of the year, except the winter,
is immediately after wheat harvest. And, as already stated, it is at
this time that John Johnston draws out his manure and spreads it on
grass-land intended to be plowed up the following spring for corn.</p>

<p>If the manure was free from weed-seeds, many of our best farmers, if
they had some well-rotted manure like this of John Johnston’s, would
draw it out and spread it on their fields prepared for winter-wheat.</p>

<p>In this case, I should draw out the manure in heaps and then spread
it carefully. Then harrow it, and if the harrow pulls the manure into
heaps, spread them and harrow again. It is of the greatest importance to
spread manure evenly and mix it thoroughly with the soil. If this work
is well done, and the manure is well-rotted, it will not interfere with
the drill. And the manure will be near the surface, where the young
roots of the wheat can get hold of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“You must recollect,” said the Doctor, “that the roots can only take
up the manure when in solution.”</p>

<p>“It must also be remembered,” said I, “that a light rain of, say,
only half an inch, pours down on to the manures spread on an acre of
land about 14,000 gallons of water, or about 56 tons. If
<span class = "pagenum">268</span>
<a name = "page268" id = "page268"> </a>
you have put on 8 tons of manure, half an inch of rain would furnish a
gallon of water to each pound of manure. It is not difficult to
understand, therefore, how manure applied on the surface, or near the
surface, can be taken up by the young roots.”</p>

<p>“That puts the matter in a new light to me,” said the Deacon. “If the
manure was plowed under, five or six inches deep, it would require an
abundant rain to reach the manure. And it is not one year in five that
we get rain enough to thoroughly soak the soil for several weeks after
sowing the wheat in August or September. And when it does come, the
season is so far advanced that the wheat plants make little growth.”</p>

<p>My own opinion is, that on clayey land, manure will act much quicker
if applied on, or near the surface, than if plowed under. Clay mixed
with manure arrests or checks decomposition. Sand has no such effect. If
anything, it favors a more active decomposition, and hence, manure acts
much more rapidly on sandy land than on clay land. And I think, as a
rule, where a farmer advocates the application of manure on the surface,
it will be found that he occupies clay land or a heavy loam; while those
who oppose the practice, and think manure should be plowed under, occupy
sandy land or sandy loam.</p>

<p>“J.&nbsp;J. Thomas,” said I, “once gave me a new idea.”</p>

<p>“Is that anything strange,” remarked the Deacon. “Are ideas so scarce
among you agricultural writers, that you can recollect who first
suggested them?”</p>

<p>“Be that as it may,” said I, “this idea has had a decided influence
on my farm practice. I&nbsp;will not say that the idea originated with
Mr. Thomas, but at any rate, it was new to me. I&nbsp;had always been in
the habit, when spading in manure in the garden, of putting the manure
in the trench and covering it up; and in plowing it in, I&nbsp;thought
it was desirable to put it at the bottom of the furrow where the next
furrow would cover it up.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Deacon, “and what objection is there to the
practice?”</p>

<p>“I am not objecting to the practice. I&nbsp;do not say that it is not
a good plan. It may often be the only practicable method of applying
manure. But it is well to know that there is <i>sometimes</i> a better
plan. The idea that Mr. Thomas gave me, was, that it was very desirable
to break up the manure fine, spread it evenly, and thoroughly mix it
with the soil.</p>

<p>“After the manure is spread on the soil,” said Mr. Thomas, “and
before plowing it in, great benefit is derived by thoroughly harrowing
the top-soil, thus breaking finely both the manure and the soil,
<span class = "pagenum">269</span>
<a name = "page269" id = "page269"> </a>
and mixing them well together. Another way for the perfect diffusion of
the manure among the particles of earth, is, to spread the manure in
autumn, so that, all the rains of this season may dissolve the soluble
portions and carry them down among the particles, where they are
absorbed and retained for the growing crop.</p>

<p>“In experiments,” continues Mr. Thomas, “when the manure for corn was
thus applied in autumn, has afforded a yield of about 70 bushels per
acre, when the same amount applied in spring, gave only 50 bushels.
A&nbsp;thin coating of manure applied to winter-wheat at the time of
sowing, and was harrowed in, has increased the crop from 7 to 10 bushels
per acre&mdash;and in addition to this, by the stronger growth it has
caused, as well as by the protection it has afforded to the surface, it
has not unfrequently saved the crop from partial or total
winter-killing.</p>

<p>“In cases where it is necessary to apply coarse manures at once, much
may be done in lessening the evils of coarseness by artificially
grinding it into the soil. The instrument called the
drag-roller&mdash;which is like the common roller set stiff so as not to
revolve&mdash;has been used to great advantage for this purpose, by
passing it over the surface in connection with the harrow. We have known
this treatment to effect a thorough intermixture, and to more than
double the crop obtained by common management with common manure.”</p>


<h6 class = "section">TOP-DRESSING WITH MANURE.</h6>

<p>The term “top-dressing” usually refers to sowing or spreading manures
on the growing crop. For instance, we top-dress pastures or meadows by
spreading manure on the surface. If we sow nitrate of soda, or guano, on
our winter-wheat in the spring, that would be top-dressing. We often sow
gypsum on clover, and on barley, and peas, while the plants are growing
in the spring, and this is top-dressing.</p>

<p>“If the gypsum was sown broadcast on the land before sowing the
seed,” said the Deacon, “would not that be top-dressing also?”</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, I suppose that would not be top-dressing.</p>

<p>Top-dressing in the sense in which I understand the term, is seldom
adopted, except on meadows and pastures as a regular system. It is an
after-thought. We have sown wheat on a poor, sandy knoll, and we draw
out some manure and spread on it in the winter or early spring; or we
top-dress it with hen-manure, or guano, or nitrate of soda and
superphosphate. I&nbsp;do not say that this is better than to apply the
manure at the time of sowing the
<span class = "pagenum">270</span>
<a name = "page270" id = "page270"> </a>
wheat, but if we neglect to do so, then top-dressing is a commendable
practice.</p>

<p>Dr. Vœlcker reports the result of some experiments in top-dressing
winter-wheat on the farm of the Royal Agricultural College at
Cirencester, England. The manures were finely sifted and mixed with
about ten times their weight of fine soil, and sown broadcast on the
growing wheat, March 22. A&nbsp;fine rain occurred the following day,
and washed the manure into the soil. The following is the yield per
acre:--</p>

<p>The marl did no good.</p>

<p>The nitrate of soda and common salt contained no phosphoric acid, and
yet produced an excellent effect. The guano and the wheat-manure
contained phosphoric acid as well as nitrogen, and the following crop of
clover would be likely to get some benefit from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>John Johnston wrote in 1868, “I&nbsp;have used manure only as a
top-dressing for the last 26 years, and I do think one load, used in
that way, is worth far more than two loads plowed under on our stiff
land.”</p>

<h5>MANURES ON PERMANENT MEADOWS AND PASTURES.</h5>

<p>In this country, where labor is comparatively high, and hay often
commands a good price, a&nbsp;good, permanent meadow frequently affords
as much real profit as any other portion of the farm. Now that we have
good mowing-machines, tedders, rakes, and loading and unloading
apparatus, the labor of hay-making is greatly lessened. The only
difficulty is to keep up and increase the annual growth of good
grass.</p>

<p>Numerous experiments on top-dressing meadows are reported from year
to year. The results, of course, differ considerably, being influenced
by the soil and season. The profit of the practice depends very much on
the price of hay. In the Eastern States, hay generally commands a higher
relative price than grain, and it not unfrequently happens that we can
use manure on grass to decided advantage.</p>

<p>The celebrated experiments of Messrs. Lawes &amp; Gilbert with
“Manures on Permanent Meadow-land” were commenced in 1856, and have been
continued on the same plots every year since that time.</p>

<p>“You need not be afraid, Deacon,” said I, as the old gentleman
commenced to button up his coat, “I&nbsp;am not going into the details
of these wonderful experiments; but I am sure you will be interested in
the results of the first six or seven years<ins class = "correction"

These are all the figures I will trouble you with. The “mixed mineral
manures” consisted of superphosphate of lime (composed of 150 lbs.
bone-ash and 150 lbs. sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1.7), 300 lbs. sulphate of
potash, 200 lbs. sulphate of soda, and 100 lbs. sulphate of magnesia.
The ammonia-salts consisted of equal parts sulphate and muriate of
ammonia, containing about 25 per cent. of ammonia. The manures were sown
as early as possible in the spring, and, if the weather was suitable,
sometimes in February. The farmyard-manure was spread on the land, in
the first year, in the spring, afterwards in November or December. The
hay was cut from the middle to the last of June; and the aftermath was
pastured off by sheep in October.</p>

<p>“It is curious,” said the Deacon, “that 400 lbs. of ammonia-salts
should give as great an increase in the yield of hay the first year as
14 tons of farmyard-manure, but the second year the farmyard-manure
comes out decidedly ahead.”</p>

<p>“The farmyard-manure,” said I, “was applied every year, at the rate
of 14 gross tons per acre, for eight years&mdash;1856 to 1863. After
1863, this plot was left without manure of any kind. The average yield
of this plot, during the first 8 years was 4,800 lbs. of hay per
acre<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p>On the plot dressed with 14 tons of farmyard-manure and 200 lbs.
ammonia-salts, the average yield of hay for 8 years was 5,544 lbs. per
acre. After the eighth year the farmyard-manure was discontinued, and
during the next twelve years the yield of hay averaged 3,683 lbs., or
1,149 lbs. more than the continuously unmanured plot.</p>

<p>In 1859, superphosphate of lime was used alone on plot 3, and has
been continued ever since. It seems clear that this land, which had been
in pasture or meadow for a hundred years or more, was not deficient in
phosphates.</p>

<p>“It does not seem,” said the Deacon, “to have been deficient in
anything. The twentieth crop, on the continuously unmanured plot was
nearly 1¼ ton per acre, the first cutting, and nearly ¾-ton the second
cutting. And apparently the land was just as rich in 1875, as it was in
1856, and yet over 25 tons of hay had been cut and <i>removed</i> from
the land, without any manure being returned. And yet we are told that
hay is a very exhausting crop.”</p>

<p>“Superphosphate alone,” said the Doctor, “did very little to increase
the yield of hay, but superphosphate <i>and</i> ammonia produced the
first year, 1859, over a ton more hay per acre than the superphosphate
alone, and when <i>potash</i> is added to the manure, the yield is still
further increased.”</p>

“Answer me one question,” said the Deacon, “and let us leave the
subject. In the light of these and other experiments, what do you
consider the cheapest and best manure to apply to a permanent meadow or
pasture?”</p>

<p>“Rich, well-decomposed farmyard or stable manure,” said I, “and if it
is not rich, apply 200 lbs. of nitrate of soda per acre, in addition.
This will make it rich. Poor manure, made from straw, corn-stalks, hay,
etc., is poor in nitrogen, and comparatively rich in potash. The nitrate
of soda will supply the deficiency of nitrogen. On the sea-shore
fish-scrap is a cheaper source of nitrogen, and may be used instead of
the nitrate of soda.”</p>
